## Goal

The goal of the Collatz Conjecture Challenge (ccchallenge for short) is to collaboratively formalise results about the Collatz conjecture using proof assistants.

### The Collatz conjecture

Consider the function $T(x) = x/2$ if $x$ is even and $T(x) = (3x+1)/2$ if $x$ is odd. The Collatz conjecture states that iterating $T$ for all $x_0 \in \mathbb{N}^+$ eventually reaches $1$.

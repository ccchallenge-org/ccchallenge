This paper discusses dimensions of some simple fractals,

These arise as a fixed set from combining several linear iterations. 
It then considers the Collatz function  iteration as analogous, as it is given by  set of
two linear transformations.  It looks at the tree of inverse iterates ("chalice")
and estimates emprically the number of leaves at depth at most
$k$ as growing like $c^k$ for $c \approx 1.265$. It discusses various
cascades of points that arrive at the cycle $\{ 1, 4,2\}$.

It then looks at iteration schemes of type: start with vertices of equilateral triangle,
and a new point $x_0$ not on the triangle. Then form
$f(x_0) = \frac{x_0 + x_k}{\xi}$ where $\xi >0$ is a  parameter. then iterate
with $k$ varying in any order through $1,2,3$. Depending on the value
of $\xi$ for $1 < \xi < 2$ get a fractal set, for $\xi=2$ get an orbit supported
on Sierpinski gasket. It discusses critical exponents, analogy with Julia sets,
and then the Ising model.

This paper studies generalized $3x+1$ functions of the
form proposed by Hasse. These have the form
$$
T(n) = T_{m, d, R}(n) := \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\df{mn+r_j}{d}  & \mbox{if} ~~n \equiv j~~ (\bmod ~ d),~1 \le j \le d-1 \\
~~~ \\
\df{x}{d} & \mbox{if}~~ n \equiv 0~~ (\bmod ~d )~.
\end{array}
\right.
$$
in which the parameters $(d, m)$ satisfy
$d \ge 2$, $gcd(m, d) =1$,
and  the set $R= \{ r_j: 1 \le j \le d -1\}$ has each
$r_j \equiv -mj~(\bmod~d)$.  The author  notes that
it is easy to show  that all maps in Hasse's class with $1 \le m < d$
have a finite number of cycles, and for these maps
all orbits eventually enter one of these cycles.
Thus we may assume that $m > d$. 

 
The paper proves two theorems. Theorem 1 
improves on  the results of Heppner (1978). Let $T(\cdot)$
be a function in Hasse's class with parameters $d, m$.
Let $a > 1$ be fixed and set $k = \lfloor \frac{\log x}{a \log m} \rfloor.$
Let $A, B$ be two rationals with $A < B$ that are 
not of the form $\frac{m^i}{d^j}$ for 
integers $i \ge 0, j \ge 1$,
and consider the counting function
$$
F_{a, A, B}(x) := \sum_{n=1}^{x} \chi_{(A,B)}\left( \frac{ T^{(k)}(n)}{n}\right),
$$
in which $\chi_{(A, B)}(u) = 1$ if $A < u < B$ and $0$ otherwise.
Let $C$ be the maximum of the denominators of $A$ and $B$. Then:

(i) If $A < B < 0$ then 
$$
F_{a, A, B}(x) = O\left( C x^{\frac{1}{a}} \right),
$$
where the constant implied by  the $O$-symbol is absolute.

(ii) If $B > 0$ and there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that
$$
\frac{d-1}{d} \ge  \frac{\log d}{\log m} + \frac{\log B}{k \log m} + \epsilon,
$$
then for $k > k_0(\epsilon)$, there holds 
$$
F_{a, A, B}(x) = O \left( C x^{\frac{1}{a}} + 
x^{1 - \frac{|\log \eta|}{a \log m}} \right)
$$
for some $\eta$ with $0 < \eta < 1$ which depends
on $\epsilon.$  This is true in particular
when $m > d^{\frac{d}{d-1}}$ with $B$ fixed and $x \to \infty$.

(iii) If $B > A > 0$ and if there exists $\epsilon$ such that
$$
 \frac{d-1}{d} \le \frac{\log d}{\log m} +
\frac{\log A}{k \log m} -  \epsilon,
$$
then for $k > k_0(\epsilon)$, there holds
$$
F_{a, A, B}(x) = O \left( Cx^{\frac{1}{a}} + 
x^{1 - \frac{|\log \eta|}{a \log m}} \right)
$$
for some $\eta$ with $0 < \eta < 1$ which depends
on $\epsilon.$ This is true in particular
when  $m < d^{\frac{d}{d-1}}$, with $A$ fixed and $x \to \infty$.

Theorem 2  constructs for given values 
$d, m$ with $gcd(m, d) =1$   with $m > d \ge 2$ 
two functions $F(\cdot)$
and $G(\cdot)$ which fall slightly outside Hasse's
class and have the following properties:

(i) The function $F(\cdot)$ has a finite number of
periodic orbits, and every $n$ when iterated under $F(\cdot)$ 
eventually enters one of these orbits.

(ii) Each orbit of the  function $G(\cdot)$ is divergent, i.e.
$|G^{(k)}(n)| \to \infty$ as $k \to \infty$, for all
but a finite number of initial values $n$.

To define the first function $F(\cdot)$ pick an integer $u$ such that
$d <m < d^u$, and set 
$$
F(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\df{mx + r_j}{d}  & \mbox{if} ~~n \equiv j  (\bmod ~ d^u),~ 
gcd( j, d) = 1, \\
~~~ \\
\df{x}{d} + s_j & \mbox{if}~~ x \equiv j~~ (\bmod ~d^u),~~j 
\equiv 0 (\bmod~d).
\end{array}
\right.
$$
in which $0 < r_j < d^u$ is determined by 
 $mj + r_j \equiv 0 (\bmod~ d^u)$,
and $0 \le s_j < d^{u-1}$ is determined by
$\frac{j}{d} +  r_j \equiv 0 (\bmod~ d^{u-1})$.
The second function $G(x)$ is defined by $G(x) = F(x) + 1$.

These functions fall outside
Hasse's class because each 
 is linear on  residue classes $n (\bmod~d^u)$
for some $u \ge 2$, rather than linear on residue classes $(\bmod~d)$. 
However both  these functions exhibit behavior qualitatively like functions
in Hasse's class: There is a 
constant $C$ such that 
$$
|F(n) - \frac{n}{d}| \le C ~~\mbox{~if~}~~ n \equiv 0 ~(\bmod~d).
$$
$$
|F(n) - \frac{mn}{d}| \le C ~~\mbox{~if~}~~ n \not\equiv 0 ~(\bmod~d).
$$
and similarly for $G(n)$, taking $C= d^{u-1} + 1$.
The important difference is that functions  in Hasse's class are mixing on 
residue classes $(\bmod~d^k)$ for all powers of $k$, while
the functions $F(\cdot)$ and $G(\cdot)$ are not mixing in
this fashion. The nature of the non-mixing behaviors
of these functions underlies the proofs
of properties (i),  resp. (ii) for $F(\cdot)$, resp. $G(\cdot)$.

The authors study  the boundedness and periodicity of solutions
of the set of difference equations
$$
x_{n+1} = \left\{\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{1}{2}(\alpha x_n + \beta x_{n-1}) & \mbox{if}~~x \equiv 0~~(\bmod~2 ) ~.\\

\right.
$$
where the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \in \{ -1, 1\}$, and the
initial conditions $(x_0, x_1)$ are integers. There are $16$ possible such iterations. 
Earlier Clark and Lewis (1995) considered the case 
$(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta)=(1, 1, 1, -1)$, and showed that all orbits 
with initial conditions integers $(x_0, x_1)$ with $gcd(x_0, x_1)=1$ converge
to one of three periodic orbits .
Here the authors consider  all $16$ cases, showing first a duality between solutions of
$(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta)$ and $(-\alpha, \beta, -\gamma, \delta)$, 
taking a solution $\{ x_n\}$ of one to $\{ (-1)^{n+1} x_n\}$ of the other.
This reduces to considering the eight cases with 
$\alpha=+1$. They resolve six of these cases, as follows, leaving open the cases
$(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta)= (1, -1, 1,1)$
and $(1, -1, -1, -1)$. 




For the parameters $(1,1,1,1)$ they show all orbits are eventually constant or unbounded,
and that unbounded orbits occur. 

For the  parameters $(1,1,1,-1)$, the work of  Clark and Lewis (1995) showed all orbits
are eventually periodic.

For the parameters $(1,1,-1, 1)$ all solutions are eventually periodic, and there are
five relatively prime cycles, the fixed points $(1), (-1)$, the $4$-cycles $(2, -1, 3,1),~(-2,1,-3,1)$
and the $6$-cycle $(1,0,1,-1,0,-1)$.

For the parameters $(1,1,-1, -1)$ all solutions are eventually periodic, and there are
four relatively prime cycles,  the fixpoints $(1), (-1)$ and the $3$-cycles $ (-1,0,1),~(1,0,-1)$.



For parameters $(1, -1, 1,-1)$, all orbits are eventually periodic, with two relatively prime cycles,
 the $6$-cycle $(-1, 0,1,1, 0, -1)$. 


For parameters $(1, -1,-1, 1)$ all orbits are eventually periodic, with one relatively prime cycle, the
$8$-cycle $(0, -1, 1, 1, 0, 1, -1,-1)$.

The authors conjecture that for the two remaining cases  $(1, -1, 1,1)$
and $(1, -1, -1, -1)$, that
all orbits are eventually periodic.

Then for any $a \not\equiv 0~~(\bmod~3)$ and
sufficiently large $k$,
$(1.299)^k \leq n_k (a) \leq (1.361)^k$.
Let $\pi_k (a)$ count the number of $| n | \leq x$ which eventually
reach $a$ under iteration by $T$.
If $a \not\equiv 0~~(\bmod~3)$
then $\pi_a (x)  >  x^{.643}$ for all sufficiently large $x$.
The extremal distribution of number of leaves in $3x+1$ trees with

The extremal distribution of the number of leaves in $3x+1$ 
trees with root $a$ and
depth $k$ (under iteration of $T^{-1}$) as $a$ varies were computed for
$k \leq 30$ in Applegate and Lagarias (1995a).
These data appear to have a much narrower spread around the mean value
$( \frac{4}{3} )^k$ of leaves in a $3x+1$ tree of depth $k$ than is 
predicted by
(repeated draws from) the branching process models of 
Lagarias and Weiss (1992).
Rigorous asymptotic results are given for the branching process models.
\newline
\hspace*{.25in}
The paper also derives formulas for the expected number of 
leaves in a
$3x+1$ tree of depth $k$ whose root node is $a$ $( \bmod ~3^\ell )$.
A 3-adic limit is proved to exist almost everywhere
as $k \rightarrow \infty$, the
expected number of leaves being $W_\infty (a) \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)^k$
where the function $W_\infty : \ZZ_3^\times \rightarrow \RR$
 almost everywhere
satisies the 3-adic functional equation
$$
W_\infty( \alpha ) = \df{3}{4} \left( W_\infty ( 2 \alpha ) + 
\psi ( \alpha \bmod ~9) W_\infty \left(
\df{2 \alpha -1}{3} \right) \right) ~, \eqno{\mbox{($\ast$)}}
$$
in which $\psi ( \alpha ) = 1$ if $\alpha \equiv 2$ or $8 ( \bmod ~9 )$
and is 0 otherwise.
(Here $\ZZ_3^\ast = \{ \alpha \in \ZZ_3 : 
\alpha \not\equiv 0~ ( \bmod ~3) \}$).
It is conjectured that $W_\infty$ is continuous and everywhere nonzero.
It is an open problem to characterize solutions of the 
functional equation $( \ast )$.

\newline 
\hspace*{.25in}
This comment gives more information
of the  problem of Klamkin (1963)
concerning iteration of the original
Collatz function, which is a permutation
of the positive integers. 
Adding to the  comment of Shanks (1965),
he notes there is a method which in
principle can determine all the cycles
of a given period $p$ of this map. 
This method determines upper and lower bounds on the
integers that can appear in such a cycle.
By computer calculation he shows that
aside from the known cycles of periods
$1$, $2$, $5$ and $12$ on the nonnegative
integers, there are no other cycles of
period less than $200$. 

He gives an example casting some doubt on  the heuristic
of Shanks (1965) concerning the  possible
lengths of periods. He shows that for the 
related permutation
$f(3n) = 4n+3, f(3n+1) = 2n, f(3n+2) = 4n+1$,
which should obey a similar heuristic, 
that it has  a cycle of period $94$ ( least term $n=140$),
and  $94$
is not a denominator of the continued
fraction convergent to $\log_2 3$.

Atkin  presents a heuristic argument asserting
that the Collatz permutation  should
only have a finite number of cycles,
since the iterates grow ``on average''
at an exponential rate.

The $3x+1$ Conjecture is
stated as Conjecture 1. The paper
proves its equivalence 
to each of Conjectures 2 and 3 below, which involve generating functions
encoding iterations of the $3x+1$  function $T(x)$.
For $m,n \ge0$ define $f_m(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  T^{ (m)} (n) z^n$ and 
$g_n(w) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty  T^{ (m)} (n) w^m.$ The paper shows that
each $f_m(z)$ is a rational function of   form
$$
f_m(z) = \frac{p_m(z)}{(1-z^{2^m})^2},
$$
where $p_m(z)$ is a polynomial of degree $2^{m+1}-1$ with integer coefficients. Conjecture 2
asserts that each $g_n(w)$ is a rational function of  the form
$$
g_n(w) = \frac{q_n(w)}{1-w^2},
$$
where $q_n(w)$ is a polynomial with integer
coefficients, with no bound assumed on its degree.
Concerning functional equations,  the authors show first that the $f_m(z)$ satisfy the
recursions
$$
f_{m+1}(z^3)= f_m(z^6)+ \frac{1}{3z} \sum_{j=0}^2 \omega^j f_m(\omega^j z^2),
$$
in which $\omega:= \exp\left( \frac{2 \pi i}{3} \right)$
is a  nontrivial cube root of unity. They also consider the
bivariate generating function $F(z,w) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty
\sum_{n=0}^\infty T^{(m)} (n) z^n w^m$, which converges for $|z| < 1$
and $|y| < \frac{2}{3}$ to an analytic function of two complex variables.
The authors show that it satisfies the functional equation 
$$
F(z^3 ,w) = \frac{z^3}{(1-z^3 )^2} + wF (z^6 , w)
+ \frac{w}{3z} \sum_{j=0}^2 \omega^j F(\omega^j z^2, w)~.
$$
They prove that this functional equation determines $F(z,w)$ uniquely, i.e. there
is only one analytic function of two variables in a neighborhood of $(z,w)=(0,0)$
satisfying it. Next they consider a one-variable  functional
equation obtained from this one
by formally setting $w=1$ (note this falls outside the known region
of analyticity of the function), and  dropping the non-homogenous term. This
functional equation is 
$$
h(z^3) = h(z^6) + \frac{1}{3z} \sum_{j=0}^2 \omega^j h( \omega^j z^2 ).
$$
Conjecture 3 asserts that the only 
solutions $h(z)$ of this functional equation that are
analytic in the unit disk $|z| <    1$ are $h(z)= c_0 + c_1(\frac{ z}{1-z})$ for complex
constants $c_0 , c_1$.

This paper reviews the results of Berg and Meinardus (1994) and adds
some new results. The first new result  considers the functional equation
$$
h(z^3) = h(z^6) + \frac{1}{3z} \sum_{j=0}^2 \omega^{j }h( \omega^{j }z^2 ).
$$
with $\omega:= \exp\left( \frac{2 \pi i}{3} \right)$, and shows 
that the only solutions
$h(z)$ that are entire functions are  constants. 
 The authors next transform 
this functional equation 
%for functions $h(z)$ analytic on the unit disk  
to an equivalent
 system of two functional equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
h(z)+ h(-z) &= &  2 h(z^2)\\
h(z^3) - h(-z^3) &=& \frac{2}{3z} \sum_{j=0}^2 \omega^{j }h( \omega^{j}z^2).
\end{eqnarray*}
They observe that  analytic solutions  on the open unit disk to
these  two functional equations can be studied separately. 
The second one is the most interesting. 
Set $\Phi(z):= \int_{0}^z h(z) dz$ for $|z|<1.$ Making the change of
variable $z= e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3} \xi}$, the unit disk $|z|<1$ is mapped to the upper
half plane $Im(\xi)>0$. Letting $\phi(\xi):= \Phi ( e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3} \xi})$ 
the second functional equation above becomes
$$
\phi(3 \xi) + \phi(3\xi+ \frac{3}{2}) = \phi(2 \xi) + \phi(2\xi+1) + \phi(2 \xi +2).
$$
Here we also require $\phi(\xi)= \phi(\xi+3)$. The authors remark that it might also
be interesting to study solutions to this functional equation for $\xi$ on the
real axis. The paper concludes with new formulas for the rational
functions $f_m(z)$ studied in Berg and Meinardus (1994).

This paper studies the map 
$ \Phi : \ZZ_2  \rightarrow  \ZZ_2$ of Bernstein (1994)
that conjugates the 2-adic shift map to the $3x+1$ function.
This is the inverse of the map $Q_\infty$ in Lagarias (1985); 
see also Akin (2004).
The map $ \bar{\Phi}_n  \equiv   \Phi ~ (\bmod  ~2^n)$ is a permutation of
$\ZZ / 2^n \ZZ$.
This permutation is shown to have order $2^{n-4}$ for $n  \geq  6$.
Let $ \hat{\Phi}_n$ denote the restriction of this permutation to
$( \ZZ / 2^n \ZZ )^\ast =  \{ x: x   \equiv  1~  (\bmod~2) \}$.
The function $ \Phi $ has two odd fixed points $x =  -1$ and $x =  1/3$ 
and the 2-cycle
$\{ 1,  - 1/3 \}$, hence each $ \hat{\Phi}_n$ inherits 
two 1-cycles and a 2-cycle
coming from these points.
Empirical evidence indicates that $ \hat{\Phi}_n$ has about $2n$
fixed points for $n \leq 1000$.
A heuristic argument based on this data suggests that 
$-1$ and $1/3$ are the only
odd fixed points of $ \Phi $.
The analogous conjugacy map $ \Phi_{25, -3}$ for the `$25x-3$' problem
is shown to have no nonzero fixed points.

A {\em 3-smooth representation} of an integer $n$ is
a representation as a sum of distinct positive integers each of which has the
form $2^a 3^b$, and no term divides any other term.  This paper
proves a conjecture of Erdos and Lewin that for each
integer $t$ all sufficiently large integers have a  3-smooth representation
with all individual terms larger than $t$. They note a
connection of 3-smooth representations to the $3x + 1$-problem,
 which is that a number $m$ iterates
to $1$ under the $3x+1$ function if and only if there are positive
integers $e$ and $f$
such that $n = 2^e - 3^f m$ is a positive integer that 
 has a 3-smooth
representation with $f$ terms in which there is one term exactly 
divisible by each 
power of three from $0$ to $f - 1$. The choice of $e$ and $f$ is not
unique, if it exists.

The authors are primarily concerned
with  cycles of a generalization of the $3x+1$
function. They consider the recursion in which $x_{n+1} = a x_n +b$,
if a given  recursive predicate
$P(x_n)$ is true, and $x_{n+1} = c x_n + d$ if the predicate $P(x_n)$
false, where $a, b, c, d$ and $x_n$
are rational numbers.  They observe that as a consequence of linearity alone
there are at most $2^k$ possible cycles of period $k$, corresponding
to all possible sequences of ``true'' and ``false'' of length $n$.
Furthermore one can effectively determine the $2^n$ rationals that are the
solutions to each of these equations and check if they give cycles.
Thus in principle one can determine all cycles below any given 
finite bound. They observe that a rational number $x$ in
a cycle of the $3x+1$-function $T(\cdot)$ 
of period $n$ necessarily has the form
$$
x = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^{m-k-1} 2^{v_k}}{2^n - 3^m}
$$
with $0 \le v_0 < v_1 < ... < v_m =n$. They deduce  that
every integer $x$ in a cycle of length $n$ necessarily has
$|x| < 3^n.$  

Further study of rational cycles of the $3x+1$ function
appears in Lagarias (1990).

{\em Sur un probl\`{e}me de R. Queneau},

\hspace*{.25in}
This paper considers a  problem proposed by Queneau (1963)
in connection with rhyming patterns in poetry. It concerns,
 for a fixed $n \ge 2$,
iteration of the map on the integers
$$
\delta_n(x) := \left\{ 
 \begin{array}{cl}
\df{x}{2} & ~~\mbox{if} ~~x  ~~\mbox{is ~even}\\
~&~\\
\df{2n+ 1-x}{2} & ~~\mbox{if} ~~x  ~~\mbox{is ~odd}\\
\end{array}
%\.
\right.
$$
This map acts as a permutation on the integers $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$ and
it also has the fixed point $\delta_n(0)=0$. It is called by the author
a  spiral permutation of $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$.  
The paper studies for which $n$ this spiral  is a cyclic permutation, and calls such
numbers {\em admissible}. 

The motivation for this problem was that this permutation for $n=6$ represents
a poetic stanza pattern, the sestina,  used in poems by an 11th century Troubadour, Arnaut Daniel. 
This pattern for general $n$ was studied by Raymond Queneau (1963),
% a member of the French mathematical-literary group Oulipo. 
who determined  small values
of $n$ giving  a cyclic permutation. His colleague Jacques Roubaud (1969) termed
these rhyme schemes $n-$ines or {\em quenines}.
Later he called these numbers  {\em Queneau numbers}, cf. Robaud (1993). 

In this paper the author, a student of Roubaud, shows that a necessary condition for a number $n$ to
be admissible  is that $p=2n+1$ be prime. She shows that
a sufficient condition to be admissible is that
$2$ be a primitive root $(\bmod ~p)$. 
She deduces that if $n$ and $2n+1$ are  both primes then $n$ is admissible, and 
that the numbers $n=2^k$ and $n=2^k -1$ are never admissible.
Finally she shows that all $p \equiv 1 ~(\bmod ~8)$
are not admissible.


{\em Note.} The function $\delta_n(x)$ is defined on the integers, and  is  of
$3x+1$ type (i.e. it is a periodically linear function).  Its long term behavior under iteration is 
 analyzable because the function $\delta_n(x)$ 
 decreases absolute value on each iteration for any $x$ with $|x|> 2n+1.$  Thus all
 orbits eventually enter $-2n-1\le x\le 2n+1$ and become eventually periodic.
 One can further show that all orbits eventually enter the region $\{0, 1,..., n\}$ on which 
 $\delta_n(x)$ is a permutation.

A periodically linear function $f : \ZZ  \rightarrow  \ZZ$ is one which
is a linear function on each congruence class $(\bmod L$) for 
some finite $L$.
The author shows it is undecidable whether a given function has 
$f^{(k)} (1) =  0$

for each $n \geq  1$, some $f^{(k)} (n) =  0$.
He also shows
that the $3x+1$ conjecture is equivalent to a
certain functional equation having only the trivial solution
over the set of all
power-series $R(z) =  \sum_{n=}^\infty  a_n z^n$
with all $a_i =  0$ or 1.
The functional equation is
$$

R ( \omega z^2 ) -R ( \omega^2  z^2 ) = 0

Cadogan (1984) reduced the $3x+1$ problem to the study of its
iterations on numbers $A_1=\{n: n \equiv 1~~(\bmod~4)\}$. Here the author
notes in particular  the subclass $A=\{ 1, 5, 21, 85,...\}$ where $x_{i+1} = 1+ 4x_i$ of $A_1$.
He considers the successive odd numbers occurring in the iteration. 
He forms a two-dimensional table partitioning all odd integers in which $A_1$ is the first row
and the first column of the table is called the anchor set (see Cadogan (1996) for more details) .
He observes that  Cadogan (1984) showed the iteration on higher rows
successively moves down rows to the first row, but from  row $A_1$ is flung back to 
higher rows, except for the subclass $A$, which remains on  the first row.
He comments that after
each revisit to row $A_1$ "the path may become increasingly
unpredictable." He concludes, concerning further work: "The target set $A_1$ is being vigorously
investigated."

This paper studies itertion of the Collatz function $C(x)$, which is here denoted $f(x)$,
and it includes most of the results of Cadogan (1991). 
The author  gives various criteria under  which trajectories will coalesce.
He partitions the odd integers $2\NN+1= \cup_{k=1}^{\infty} R_k$, in which
 $R_m= \{ n\equiv 2^m -1 ~(\bmod~2^{m+1})\}$.
It enumerates their elements $R_{m, j} = (2^m -1)+ (j-1) 2^{m+1}.$
and views these in an infinite two-dimensional array in which the $j$-th column $C_j$ consists
of the numbers $\{ R_{m, j}:  m \ge 1\}$.  Cadogan (1984)  showed that if
$x \in R_m$ for some $m \ge 2$, then $f^{(2)}(x) \in R_{m-1}$, thus after $2m$ iterations
one reaches an element of $R_1$.  Lemma 3.3 here observes that consecutive 
elements in columns are related by
by $R_{m+1, j} = 1+ 2 R_{m, j}.$  
For the
first set $R_1= \{ n \equiv 1~(\bmod~4)\}$, Theorem 4.1 observes that if $y=4x+1$ then $f^{(3)}(y)= f(x)$. 
The author creates chains $\{x_n: n\ge 1\}$ related by $x_{n+1}= 4 x_n +1$
and calls these $S$-related elements. Theorem 4.2 then observes that the trajectories
of $S$-related elements coalesce. 
%The paper concludes  with a recipe which 
 %given an odd integer $n$ will locate the unique pair $(m,j)$ for which $R_{m,j}=n$.

This paper studies the iterates on $\RR$ of the function
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(x) & = & \df{\pi x}{2} \left( \cos \frac{\pi x}{2}\right)^2 + 
\df{3x+1}{2} \left( \sin \df{\pi x}{2}\right)^2 \\

\end{eqnarray*}
which interpolates the $3x+1$ function $T(\cdot)$.
A fact crucial to the analysis is that $f$ has negative Schwartzian derivative
$Sf = \frac{f'''}{f'} - \frac{3}{2} \left( \frac{f''}{f'} \right)^2$
on $\RR^+$.
On the interval $[0, \mu_1 )$, where $\mu_1 = 0.27773 \ldots~$ 
all iterates of $f$ contract to a fixed point 0. 
Here $\mu_n$ denotes the $n-th$ positive fixed point of $f$.
The interval $[\mu_1 , \mu_3 ]$ is invariant under $f$,
where $\mu_3 = 2.44570 \ldots$ and this interval includes the trivial
cycle $A_1 = \{ 1,2 \}$.
On this interval almost every point is attracted to one of two
attracting cycles, which are $A_1$ and 
$A_2 = \{ 1.19253 \ldots ,~ 2.13865 \ldots \}$.
There is also an uncountable set of measure 0 on which the dynamics is
``chaotic.''
On the interval $[\mu_3 , \infty )$
the set of $x$ that do not eventually iterate to a point in 
$[ \mu_1 , \mu_3 ]$
is conjectured to be of measure zero.
The point $\mu_3$ is proved to be a ``homoclinic point,''
in the sense that for any $\epsilon > 0$ the iterates of
$[ \mu_3 , \mu_3 + \epsilon )$
cover the whole interval
$( \mu_1 , \infty )$.
It is shown that any nontrivial cycle of the $3x+1$ function on the 
positive integers would be an attracting
periodic orbit of $f$.

This list contains two problems about iterating affine maps.
Problem 1 asks whether the set of all positive integers reachable from $1$
using the maps $x \mapsto 2x+1$ and $x \mapsto 3x+1$ can be 
partitioned into a disjoint union  of  infinite arithmetic progressions. 
Problem 14 considers for nonnegative integers $(m_1, ..., m_r)$ the
set $S = \langle m_1x_1+ \cdots + m_r x_r: 1\rangle $ which is the smallest set
of natural numbers containing $1$ and which is closed under the operation
of adjoining $m_1x_1 +\cdots + m_r x_r$ whenever $x_i$ are in the set.
It states that Klarner has shown that $S$ is a finite union of arithmetic progressions
provided that $(i)$ $r \ge 2$, $(ii)$ the greatest common divisor $(m_1, ..., m)r)=1$,
and, $(iii)$ the greatest common divisor $(m_1+m_2 + \cdots +m_r, \prod_{i} m_i) = 1.$
It asks if the same conclusion holds if hypothesis (iii) is dropped.


{\em Note.}  Problem 1 was solved in the affirmative in Coppersmith (1975).

This paper studies the first order system of nonlinear difference equations
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_{n+1} & = & \lfloor \frac{x_n+y_n}{2} \rfloor\\
y_{n+1} &=& y_n - x_n,
\end{eqnarray*}
where  $\lfloor . \rfloor$ is the floor function (greatest integer function). Let 
$T(x, y) = ( \lfloor \frac{x+y}{2}\rfloor, y-x)$ be a map of the plane, noting that 
$T(x_n, y_n) = (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$. The function
$T$ is an invertible map of the plane, with inverse $S= T^{-1}$ given
by  $S(x,y)=( \lceil x - \frac{y}{2} \rceil, \lceil x+ \frac{y}{2} \rceil)$, using
the ceiling function $\lceil .\rceil$. 
One obtains an associated linear map of the plane,  by not imposing the floor function
above., i.e. $\tilde{T}(x, y) = ( \frac{x+y}{2}, -x+y)$.  The map $\tilde{T}$  is invertible, 
and  for arbitrary real initial conditions $(x_0, y_0)$ the full orbit 
$\{ \tilde{T}^{(k)}(x_0, y_0): -\infty < k < \infty\}$
 is bounded, with all points on it being confined to an invariant ellipse.
 The effect of the floor function is to  perturb this linear
dynamics. The authors focus on the question of whether all orbits having
integer initial conditions $(x_0, y_0)$ remain bounded; however they don't
resolve this question. 
Note that integer initial conditions imply the full orbit is integral;
then  invertibility implies
that bounded orbits of this type must be periodic.


The difference equation given above for integer initial conditions $(x_0, y_0)$
can  be transformed to a second order nonlinear recurrence by 
eliminating the variable $x_n$, obtaining. 
$$
y_{n+1} :=\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{3y_{n}+1}{2} - y_{n-1}  & \mbox{if} ~~y_n  \equiv 1~~ (\bmod ~ 2) \\
~~~ \\
\frac{3y_{n}}{2} - y_{n-1}  & \mbox{if}~~ y_n \equiv 0~~ (\bmod ~2 )~.
\end{array}
\right.
$$
with integer initial conditions $(y_0, y_1)$.  They note a resemblance of
this recurrence in form
to the $3x+1$ problem, and 
view  boundedness of orbits as a (vague) analogue of the $3x+1$ Conjecture.
Experimentally they observe that all integer orbits appear
to be periodic, but the period of such orbits varies erratically with the
initial conditions. For example the starting
condition $(64,0)$ for $T$ has period 87, but that of $(65,0)$ has period 930.
They give a criterion (Theorem 1) for an integer orbit to be unbounded, but conjecture it is never
satisfied.

(greatest integer function). Let $T(x, y) = ( \lfloor \frac{x+y}{2}\rfloor,
y-x)$ be a map of the plane, noting that $T(x_n, y_n) = (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$. The
function $T$ is an invertible map of the plane, with inverse $S= T^{-1}$ given
by $S(x,y)=( \lceil x - \frac{y}{2} \rceil, \lceil x+ \frac{y}{2} \rceil)$,
using the ceiling function $\lceil .\rceil$. One obtains an associated linear
map of the plane, by not imposing the floor function above., i.e. $\tilde{T}(x,
y) = ( \frac{x+y}{2}, -x+y)$. The map $\tilde{T}$ is invertible, and for
arbitrary real initial conditions $(x_0, y_0)$ the full orbit $\{
\tilde{T}^{(k)}(x_0, y_0): -\infty < k < \infty\}$ is bounded, with all points
on it being confined to an invariant ellipse. The effect of the floor function
is to perturb this linear dynamics. The authors focus on the question of whether
all orbits having integer initial conditions $(x_0, y_0)$ remain bounded;
however they don't resolve this question. Note that integer initial conditions
imply the full orbit is integral; then invertibility implies that bounded orbits
of this type must be periodic. The difference equation given above for integer
initial conditions $(x_0, y_0)$ can be transformed to a second order nonlinear
recurrence by eliminating the variable $x_n$, obtaining. $$ y_{n+1} :=\left\{
\begin{array}{cl} \frac{3y_{n}+1}{2} - y_{n-1} & \mbox{if} ~~y_n \equiv 1~~
(\bmod ~ 2) \\ ~~~ \\ \frac{3y_{n}}{2} - y_{n-1} & \mbox{if}~~ y_n \equiv 0~~
(\bmod ~2 )~. \end{array} \right. $$ with integer initial conditions $(y_0,
y_1)$. They note a resemblance of this recurrence in form to the $3x+1$ problem,
and view boundedness of orbits as a (vague) analogue of the $3x+1$ Conjecture.
Experimentally they observe that all integer orbits appear to be periodic, but
the period of such orbits varies erratically with the initial conditions. For
example the starting condition $(64,0)$ for $T$ has period 87, but that of
$(65,0)$ has period 930. They give a criterion (Theorem 1) for an integer orbit
to be unbounded, but conjecture it is never satisfied. The paper also studies
properties of periodic orbits imposed by some symmetry operators. They introduce
the operator $Q(x,y):= ( \lfloor -x + \frac{y}{2})\rfloor, y)$, observe it is an
involution $Q^2=I$ satisfying $(TQ)^2=I$ and $S= QTQ^{-1}$. They also introduce
a second symmetry operator $U(x,y): = (-x, 1-y)$ which is is an involution
$U^2=I$ that commutes with $T$. These operators are used to imply some symmetry

{\em Unpredicatable Iterations},

This paper states the $3x+1$ problem, and shows
that a more general function iteration problem similar in form to
the $3x+1$ problem  is computationally undecidable.

The paper considers functions $f: \ZZ \to \ZZ$ for which there
exists a finite modulus $N$ and rational numbers
$\{a_j : 0 \le j \le N-1 \}$ such that 
$$
g(n) = a_j n ~~~\mbox{if}~~ n \equiv j~(\bmod~N).
$$
In order that the map take integers to integers it is
necessary that the denominator of $a_j$ divide $gcd(j, N)$.
The computationally undecidable question becomes: Given an
$f(\cdot)$ in this class and an input value $n = 2^k$ decide
whether or not some iterate of $n$ is a power of $2$.
More precisely, he shows that for any recursive 
function $f(n)$ there exists a choice of $g(\cdot)$ such
that for each $n$ there holds
$2^{f(n)} = g^{k}(2^n)$ for some $k \ge 1$ and
this is the smallest value of $k$ for which the
iterate is a power of $2$.
It follows that there is no decision procedure to 
recognize if the iteration of such a function, starting
from input $n=2^j$, will ever encounter another power of
$2$, particularly whether it will encounter the value $1$.
%For if it could, then it could recognize all recursive
%functions.

The proof uses an encoding of computations in the exponents
$e_p$ of a multiplicative factorization
$n = 2^{e_2} \cdot 3^{e_3} \cdot ..$,  in which only a fixed
finite number of exponents $(e_2, e_3, ..., e_{p_r})$
control the computation, corresponding to the primes dividing
the numerators and denominators of all $a_j$.
The computation is based on  a machine model with
a finite number registers storing integers of arbitrary size,
(the exponents $(e_2, e_3, ..., e_{p_r})$)
and there is a finite state controller.
These are 
called {\em Minsky machines} in the literature,
and are described in  Chapter 11 of 
M. Minsky, {\em Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines},
Prentice-Hall: Englewood Cliffs, NJ 1967 (especially Sec. 11.1).

Conway (1987) later formalized  this computational model 
as FRACTRAN,
and also constructed a 
universal function $f(\cdot)$. See Burckel (1994) for other 
undecidability results.

FRACTRAN is a method of universal computation based on 
Conway's (1972)  earlier analysis in ``Unpredictable Iterations.''
Successive computations are done by multiplying the current
value of the computation, a positive  integer, by one of a finite list
of fractions, according to a definite rule which guarantees
that the resulting value is still an integer. A  FRACTRAN program
iterates a function $g(.)$ of the form 
$$
g(m) := \frac{p_r}{q_r}m   ~~~~\mbox{if}   ~~m \equiv r ~ (\bmod~N),  ~~0 \le r \le N-1, 
$$
and each fraction $\frac{p_r}{q_r}$  is positive with 
 denominator $q_r$ dividing $gcd(N, r)$,
so that the function takes positive integers as positive integers. 
If the input integer is of the form
 $m=2^n$ then the FRACTRAN program is said to {\em halt} at the first value
encountered which is again a power of $2$, call it  $2^{f(n)}$. The output $f(n)= \ast$ is
undefined if the program never halts. A FRACTRAN
program is regarded as computing the
partial recursive function $\{ f(n) ~:~ n \in \ZZ_{>0}\}$.
FRACTRAN programs can compute any partial recursive function.
The paper gives a number of  examples of FRACTRAN programs, e.g. 
for computing the decimal digits of $\pi$, and for computing the
successive primes. The prime producing algorithm was  described
earlier  in Guy (1983b).

Section 11 of the paper  discusses generalizations of the 3x+1 problem 
encoded as FRACTRAN programs, including a fixed such function for
which the halting problem is undecidable.

This paper studies sets  of nonnegative integers 
$S =\langle a_1x+ b_1, ..., a_k x+ b_k: c_1,..., c_m \rangle$
generated using a family of affine functions.
$x \mapsto a_i x + b_i$,   starting from the set of seeds
$A := \{ c_1, ..., c_m\}$. Here one proceeds  by producing new integers by 
the maps $x \mapsto a_i x + b_i$, in which all $a_i \ge 2, b_i \ge 0$ and
$c_i \ge 1$. He calls such sets {\em $RD$-sets}. Such a set is called {\em good}
if its complement can be given as a disjoint union of arithmetic progressions. 
He reduces the problem to the case of a single seed $m=1$, and shows 
that a set is good if and only if its complement can be covered with 
infinite arithmetic progressions. A (possibly negative) integer is a  {\em feedback
element}  if it is
a fixed point of some sequence of iterates of the maps above; such elements
need not be part of the $RD$-set. Theorem 1 says that for a fixed
set of maps,  if either there are no feedback elements, or  if there 
are  but no image of any of them under repeated iteration of the maps
becomes positive, then for any seed $c$ the associated
$RD$-set is good. Theorem 2 then gives a sufficient condition on a set of maps
for there to exist at least one seed giving a bad $RD$-set. In particular, Corollary 2b
says that  if  $a \ge 2, m\ge 0$ and $b \ge1$ 
then the set $S(c) := < ax + m(a-1), ax+ m(a-1) + b: c>$
is bad for some $c \ge 1$. Theorem 3 gives a stronger sufficient condition, very

 a set of operators to have some seed giving a bad $RD$-set.  The author
 asserts that this sufficient condition is ``almost necessary."

 $S := \langle 2x+1, 3x+1: 1 \rangle$ is a good set.
 That it is a good set follows using Theorem 1,  since it is easy to show by induction 
 that all  operators obtained by composition necessarily have the form $ax+ b$
 with $a >b \ge 1$, so such operators have a fixed point  $x$ satisfying $-1 < x < 0$. Thus
 this set of operators has no feedback elements. Theorem 1 imples that

This paper studies iteration of the  ``3x+1'' map
and more generally the ``$qx +r$'' map
$$
T_{q,r}(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{qx+r}{2} & \mbox{if} ~~x \equiv 1~~ (\bmod~2) ~. \\
~~~ \\
\frac{x}{2} & \mbox{if}  ~~x \equiv 0~~ (\bmod~2)~.

\right.
$$
in which $q>1$ and $r \ge 1$ are both odd integers. He
actually considers iteration of the  map $C_{q,r}(\cdot)$ acting
on the domain of positive odd integers, given by
$$
C_{q,r}(x) = \frac{qx+r}{2^{e_2(qx+r)}},
$$
where $e_2(x)$ denotes the highest power of $2$ dividing $x$.

Most results of the paper concern the map $C_{3,1}(\cdot)$
corresponding to the $3x+1$ map.
He first presents a heuristic probabilistic argument why iterates
of $C_{3,1}(\cdot)$  should decrease at an exponential rate, 
based on this he formulates a conjecture  that the
number of steps $H(x)$ starting from $x$
needed to reach $1$ under iteration of $C_{3,1}(\cdot)$
should be approximately
$H(x) \approx \frac{\log x}{\log \frac{16}{9}}$
for most integers.
He proves that the number of odd integers $n$ taking exactly $h$
steps to reach $1$ is at least $\frac{1}{h!} (\log_2 x)^h$.
He deduces  that the function $\pi_1(x)$ which counts
the number of odd integers below $x$ that eventually reach
$1$ under iteration of $C_{3,1}(\cdot)$  has
$\pi_1(x) > x^c$ for a positive constant $c$. (He does not
compute its value, but his proof seems to give  $c= 0.05$.)
He shows there are no cycles of length less than 17985
aside from the trivial cycle, using approximations to
$\log_2 3$. 

Concerning the ``$qx+r$'' problem, he formulates the
conjecture that, aside from $(q, r) = (3,1)$, 
every map $C_{q,r}(\cdot)$ has
at least one orbit that never visits $1$.
He proves that this conjecture is true whenever $r \ge 3$, and
in the remaining case $r=1$ he proves it for $q = 5$, $q=181$ and $q=1093$.
For the first two cases he exhibits a periodic orbit not
containing $1$, while for $q=1093$ he uses
the fact that there are no numbers of height $2$ above $1$,
based on  the congruence $2^{q-1} \equiv 1~ (\bmod~ q^2)$.
(This last argument would apply as well to  $q= 3511$.)
He argues the conjecture is true in the remaining cases because
a heuristic probabilistic argument suggests that for each $q \ge 5$ the
``$qx+1$'' problem should have a divergent trajectory.

The author considers iteration of the map $f: \ZZ^{+} \to \ZZ^{+}$ given
by 
$$
f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{3n+1}{2}  & \mbox{if} ~~n \equiv 1~~ (\bmod ~ 2), n> 1 \\

\frac{n}{2} & \mbox{if}~~ n \equiv 0~~ (\bmod ~2 )~ \\
~~~\\
1  & \mbox{if}~~ n=1,
\end{array}
\right.
$$
This is essentially the $3x+1$ function, except for $n=1$. 
He calls a sequence of iterates  of this map  a {\em circuit}
if it starts with an odd number $n$, produces a sequence of odd
numbers followed by a sequence of even numbers, ending at
an odd number $n^{*}$. A circuit is a {\em cycle} if
$n= n^{*}.$  

Based on computer evidence, he conjectures that the
number of circuits required during the iteration of a
number $n$ to $1$ is at most $K \log n$, for some
absolute constant $K$. He presents a probabilistic
heuristic argument in support of this conjecture.

He asks whether a circult can ever be a cycle.
He shows that this
question can be formulated as the exponential
Diophantine equation: There exists
a circuit that is a cycle if and
only if there exist positive integers
$(k, l, h)$ satisfying
$$ 
(2^{k+l} - 3^k)h = 2^l - 1.
$$
(Here there are $k$ odd numbers and $l$ even numbers
in the cycle, and 
$h= \frac{n+1}{2^k}$ where $n$ is the smallest
odd number in the cycle.) 
The trivial cycle $\{1,2\}$ of the $3x+1$ map
corresponds to the solution $(k, l, h) = (1, 1, 1)$,
Davison states he has been unable to find any other solutions.
He notes that the $5x+1$ problem has a circuit that is a 
cycle. 

Steiner (1978) subsequently showed that $(1,1,1)$ is the only 
positive solution
to the exponential Diophantine equation above.

integers obtained from a given set $A$ under iteration of a finite set $R$ of

nonnegative integer $m_i$ for $i \ge 1$. 
Denoting this set $< R: A>$, one can ask for the size and structure of this
set. In the case of one variable functions $R= \{ a_1 x + b_1, ..., a_r x+ b_r\}$
Erd\H{o}s showed (see Klarner and Rado (1974)) that if $\sum \frac{1}{a_i}<1$,
then the set has density $0$. The case when $\sum \frac{1}{a_i} =1$
is pointed to as a source of unresolved problems. Erd\H{o}s had proposed as
a prize problem: For $R = \{ 2x+1, 3x+1, 6x+1\}$  and $A= \{ 1\}$ is the set $<R: A>$
of positive density? This was answered in the negative by D. J. Crampin and A. J. W. Hilton

them to some data on the $3x+1$ function. In Sect. 2

and predicts that the number of leaves at level $k$ of the tree should
grow approximately like $A (\frac{4}{3})^k$ as $k \to \infty$. In

{\em Growth properties of a class of recursively defined functions,}
Ph. D. Thesis, Stanford University, June 1972, 81 pages\\

 Let $g(n)$ be a given function.
 This  thesis discusses solutions of the general recurrence 
$M(0)= g(0)$,
 $$M(n+1) := g(n+1) + \min_{0 \le k \le n} \left( \alpha M(k) + \beta M(n-k) \right), $$
 in which $\alpha, \beta > 0$. 
It has three chapters and a conclusion.
 The first two chapters concern the special case where $g(n)=n$,
Chapter 3 considers more general cases. 
The author how the quantity $M(n)$ has an interpretation in terms of minimum total
weight of weighted binary trees having $n$ nodes. For the analysis in the $h(n)=n$ case.
Theorem 2.1 sets $D(n) = M(n) -M(n-1)$  and sets $h(x) = \sum_{\{j: D(j)) \le x\}} 1$,
and shows that $h(x)$ satisfies 
 $h(x)=1$ for $0 \le x < 1$ and the functional equation
$$
h(x) = 1+ h(\frac{x-1}{\alpha}) + h(\frac{x-1}{\beta}).
$$
It determines the growth rates of $h(x)$ and $M(x)$ in many circumstances.
We describe here results only for the case  $\min( \alpha, \beta) >1$.
Let $\gamma$ be the unique positive solution to $\alpha^{-\gamma} +\beta^{-\gamma} =1$.
It is shown that the function $h(x)$ has order of magnitude $x^{\gamma}$ while 
$M(x)$ has order of magnitude $x^{1+ \frac{1}{\gamma}}$. 
Theorem 2.3.2 states that  $\lim_{x \to \infty} h(x) x^{-\gamma}$ exists if and only
if $\lim_{x \to \infty} M(x) x^{-1-\frac{1}{\gamma}}$ exists. It is shown the limits always
exist if $\frac{\log \alpha}{\log \beta} $ is irrational, but in general do not exist 
when $\frac{\log \alpha}{\log \beta} $ is rational. Chapter 3 obtains less precise growth
rate information for a wide class of driving functions $g(x)$. 
Some of the proofs use complex analysis and Tauberian theorems for Dirichlet series.
The conclusion of the thesis states 
applications and open problems. One given application is to answer a question
raised by Klarner, see  Klarner and Rado (1974). 
Fredman shows that the set $S$
of integers obtained starting from $1$ and  iterating the affine maps $x \mapsto 2x+1$,
$x \mapsto 3x+1$ has density $0$, and in fact the number of such integers below $x$ is at
most $O( x^{\gamma}$ where $2^{-\gamma} + 3^{-\gamma} =1$.
 (Here $\gamma \approx 0.78788$.) This result  follows from an upper bound on 
 growth of $h(x)$
 above when $\alpha=2, \beta=3,  g(n)=n$.
 It uses the fact that the function  $h(x)$ has an interpretation as counting  the number
of elements $\le x$ in the multiset 
$\tilde{S} := \cup_{ j=0}^\infty S_j $ generated by initial element $S_0= \{1\} $ and
inductively letting $S_{j+1}$ being the image of $S_j$ under

This paper studies the asymptotics of solutions of the general recurrence
$M(0)= g(0)$,
 $$M(n+1) := g(n+1) + \min_{0 \le k \le n} \left( \alpha M(k) + \beta M(n-k) \right), $$
for various choices of $\alpha, \beta, g(n)$. They denote this $M_{g \alpha \beta}(n)$
In \S2-\S4 they   treat the case $g(n)=n$, where they develop an interpretation of
this quantity in terms of weighted binary trees.; $M_{g\alpha \beta}$ is the minimum
total weight of any rooted binary tree with $n$ nodes. The weight of  a nodes in a 
finite binary tree $T$ is
given by assigning the root node $\sigma= \epsilon$
the weight  $w(\emptyset)=1$, and then inductively defining
$w(L\sigma)= 1+ \alpha w(\sigma), w(R\sigma) = 1+ \beta w(\sigma);$
for example $w(LRR) = 1 + \alpha + \alpha \beta + \alpha \beta^2.$ The total weight function $\sM(T)$
of a tree is the sum of  the weights of all nodes in it. They set
$M(n) := \min_{T: |T|=n}  \sM(T),$ and show this 
quantity is $M_{g \alpha \beta} (n)$ for $g(n)=n$. 
In \S4 they analyze the asymptotic behavior  of $M(n)$ in the case $\min(\alpha, \beta) >1$. 
They let $H(x)=h(x)+1$ where $h(x)$
counts the number of node weights $w(\sigma) \le x$ and observe that
it satisfies $H(x)=1$ for $0 \le x < 1$ and the functional difference equation
$$
H(x) = H(\frac{x-1}{\alpha}) + H(\frac{x-1}{\beta}).
$$
They note that $H(x)$ and $M(x)$ are 
related using the fact that a depth $n$ node has  weight $w(\sigma_n)\le x$
if and only if $H(x) > n$. Now consider the case  $\alpha, \beta > 1$,
and let $\gamma$ be
the unique positive solution to $\alpha^{-\gamma} + \beta^{-\gamma}=1.$
Lemma 4.1 shows that $H(x)$ is on the order of $x^{\gamma}$, and
$M(x)$ is on the order of $x^{1+ \frac{1}{\gamma}},$ so that  one can write
$H(x) = c(x) x^{\gamma}$, $M(x)= C(x) x^{1+ \frac{1}{\gamma}}$, where
$c(x)$ and $C(x)$ are positive bounded functions. 
The asymptotic
behaviors of $H(x)$ and $M(x)$ now depends on properties of the 
positive real number $\frac{\log \alpha}{\log \beta}$. 
 Theorem 4.1 shows
that when  $\frac{\log \alpha}{\beta}$ is rational, 
the function
$C(x)$ is usually an oscillatory function having  no limiting value at $\infty$.
Theorem 4.3  shows that
when $\frac{\log \alpha}{\beta}$ is irrational, $C(x)$ has a positive limiting value as $x \to \infty$
so that  $M(x) \sim C x^{1+ \frac{1}{\gamma}}$. (Similar results hold for $c(x)$; this
was explicitly shown in  Fredman (1972).) This paper also analyzes various cases where
$0 < \alpha,  \beta <1$ and the growth rate is polynomial. 
Some proofs use generating functions,
others use complex
analysis and Tauberian theorems.

This paper shows that infinitely many pairs of consecutive integers have
equal (finite) heights and equal total stopping times.
To do this he studies how trajectories of consecutive integers
can coalesce.
Given two consecutive integers $m$, $m  +  1$ having
$T^{(i)} (m) \neq T^{(i)} (m  +  1)$ for $i  <  k$ and
$T^{(k)} (m) =  T^{(k)} (m  +  1)$, associate to them the pair
$( \bv ,  \bv' )$
of $0  -  1$ vectors of length $k$ encoding the parity of $T^{(i)} (m)$
(resp. $T^{(i)} (m  +  1)$) for
$0  \leq  i \leq k  -  1$.
Call the set $\sA$ of pairs
$( \bv ,  \bv' )$ obtained this way {\em admissible pairs}.
Garner exhibits collections $\sB$ and $\sS$ of pairs of equal-length
$0  -  1$ vectors $( \bb ,  \bb')$ and $( \bs ,  \bs' )$ called
{\em blocks}
and
{\em strings},
respectively, which have the properties:

This paper studies subsets $S$ of $\ZZ$ or $\NN$ closed
under iteration of an affine map  $f(x_1, \cdots, x_r) = w_0 + w_1x_1 +w_2x_2+ \cdots + w_r x_r$ with
integer $w_0, w_1, ..., w_r$. 
He shows for a general function one
can reduce analysis to the case $w_0=1$
and initial seed value $0$. A polynomial $f(x_1, ... , x_r) \in \NN[x_1, ..., x_r]$
is {\em controlled} (``gebremst") if $f(x_1, ..., x_r) \preccurlyeq  (x_1+ \cdots + x_r) f(x_1, ..., x_r) + f(0,0,..., 0),$
where $f \preccurlyeq g$ means each coefficient of $f$ is no larger than the corresponding
coefficient of $g$. It is {\em $m$-controlled} if $f(0,0,  \cdots, 0) \le m.$ Let $F_{r, m}$ denote
the set of $m$-controlled polynomials in $r$ variables, and let
$F_{r, m} (w_1, ..., w_r) =\{ f(w_1, ..., w_r) : f \in F_{r,m}\}$.
Theorem 4.1 asserts that for $f := 1+ w_1 x_1 +\cdots + w_rx_r$ the smallest set
containing $0$ and closed under iteration of $f$ is $F_{r,1}(w_1, w_2, ..., w_r)$. He also shows that if
the greatest common divisor of $(w_1, ..., w_r)=1$ then (i) if $w_i$ are nonnegative then 
 $F_{r, m}(w_1, .., w_r) = \NN$ for all large enough $m$; (ii) if some $w_i$ is negative
and some other $w_i$ nonzero then for  $F_{r, m}(w_1, .., w_r) = \ZZ$
for large enough $m$.
He applies these results to obtain a  characterization of  those functions of two variables
 $f(x_1, x_2) = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2$
such that 
 the smallest set of integers
containing $0$ and closed under its action consists of all nonnegative integers $\NN$.
They are exactly those functions with $w_0=1$,  $w_1, w_2 \ge 0$, 
with greatest  common divisor $(w_1, w_2)=1$, having the extra property that
iteration $(\bmod~ w_1w_2)$ visits  all residue classes $(\bmod~ w_1w_2)$.
He also obtains a criterion  for the smallest set to be $\ZZ$.
He notes that similar results were  obtained earlier by Hoffman and Klarner (1978), (1979).

\hspace*{.25in}
Hasse  discusses the $3x+1$ problem on pp. 23--33.
He calls it the Syracuse (or Kakutani) algorithm.
He asserts that A. Fraenkel checked it for $n < 10^{50}$,
which is not the case (private communication with A. Fraenkel).
He states that Thompson has proved the Finite Cycles
Conjecture, but this seems not to be the case, as no
subsequent publication has appeared. 

He suggests a generalization $( \bmod~m)$ for $m > d \ge 2$
and in which the map is 
$$
T_d(x) := 
\frac{mx+f(r)}{d}   \mbox{if} ~~x \equiv r~~ (\bmod ~ d) 
$$
in which $f(r) \equiv -mr ~(\bmod~d)$. He gives a 
probabiliistic argument suggesting  that all orbits are
eventually periodic, when $m=d+1$. 

Hasse's circulation of the problem motivated
some of the first publications on it.  He proposed
a class of generalized $3x+1$ maps studied
in M\"{o}ller (1978) and Heppner (1978).

This paper studies iteration of generalized $3+1$ maps
that belong to a class
formulated by H. Hasse. This class consists of 
maps depending on parameters of the form
$$
T(n) = T_{m, d, R}(n) := \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\df{mn+r_j}{d}  & \mbox{if} ~~n \equiv j~~ (\bmod ~ d),~1 \le j \le d-1 \\
~~~ \\
\df{x}{d} & \mbox{if}~~ n \equiv 0~~ (\bmod ~d )~.
\end{array}
\right.
$$
in which the parameters $(d, m)$ satisfy
$d \ge 2$, $gcd(m, d) =1$,
and  the set $R= \{ r_j: 1 \le j \le d -1\}$ has each
$r_j \equiv -mj~(\bmod~d)$.  
The qualitative behavior of iterates of these maps 
are shown to depend on the
relative sizes of $m$ and $d$.

Heppner proves that if $m < d^{d/{d-1}}$ then almost all
iterates get smaller, in the following quantitative sense:
There exist positive real numbers $\delta_1, \delta_2$ such
that for any $x > d$, and 
$N = \lfloor \frac{\log x}{\log d}\rfloor$,
there holds
$$
\#\{ n \le x:~ T^{(N)}(n) \ge n x^{-\delta_1} \} = O ( x^{1 - \delta_2}).
$$
He also proves that if $m > d^{d/{d-1}}$ then
almost all iterates get larger, in the following quantitative sense:
There exist positive real numbers $\delta_3, \delta_4$ such
that for any $x > d$, and 
$N = \lfloor \frac{\log x}{\log d}\rfloor$,
there holds
$$
\#\{ n \le x:~ T^{(N)}(n) \le n x^{\delta_3} \} = O ( x^{1 - \delta_4}).
$$
In these results the constants $\delta_j$ depend on $d$ and
$m$ only while the implied constant in the $O$-symbols depends
on $m, d$ and $R$.
This results improve on those of M\"{o}ller (1978).

whether it is true that,  starting from

one can reach every such number except possibly those with $n \equiv 80~(\bmod~81),$

A {\em one-state linear operator algorithm} (OLOA) with modulus $m$,
is specified by data $(a_r, b_r, c_r)$ a triple
of integers, for each residue class $r~0\bmod~m)$.
Given an input integer $x$, the OLOA  does the following in
one step. It finds
 $x \equiv r ~(\bmod~m)$ and based on the value of $r$, it 
  does the following. 
If $c_r=0$, the machine halts and outputs $x$, calling it
a final number, 
If $c_r \ne 0$ it computes 
to $(a_r x + b_r ~\mbox{DIV} ~c_r= \frac{a_r x + b_r}{c_r}$, and
outputs this value, provided
this output is a nonnegative  integer. If $\frac{a_r x + b_r}{c_r}$ is a 
non-integer  or is negative, the the number $x$ is called a terminal number,
and the machine stops. 
An OLOA $L$ computes  a partially defined function $m \to f_{L}(m)$ as follows. 
For  initial input value  $m$, the OLOA is iterated, and halts with  $f_{L}(m)=x$ if
$x$ is a final number. Otherwise $f_{L}(m)= \uparrow$ is viewed as undefined,  
and this occurs if the computation 
either reaches a terminal number or else runs for an infinite number of 
steps without stopping.

The author observes that the $3x+1$ problem can be encoded as
an OLOA $L$ with modulus $m=30.$ The increase of modulus of the
$3x+1$ function from $m=2$ to $m=30$ is made in order to 
 encode the $3x+1$ iteration arriving at  value $1$ as a halting state in the sense above. 
 The $3x+1$ function input $n$ is encoded as the integer $m= 5\cdot 2^{n-1}$ 
 to the OLOA. It is not known if the function $f_L$ computed by this
 OLOA has a recursive domain $D(f_L)$, but  if the $3x+1$ conjecture is true,
 then $D(F_L) = \NN$ will be recursive.
 
 The main result of the paper is that there exists an OLOA $L$ with modulus $m=396$
which is a universal OLOA, i.e. there exists a unary recursive function $d$
such that $d f_{L}$ is a universal unary recursive function.  Here a   unary partial
recursive function $u$  is
{\em universal} it there exists 
some binary recursive function $c$ such that $F_x(y)= u c(x,y)$
where $F_x(y)$ is an encoding of the $x$-th function in an encoding of all
unary partial recursive function, evaluated at input $y$.
In particular this machine $L$  has an unsolvable halting problem, i.e. 
the function $f_L$ has domain $D(f_L)$ which is not recursive.

specified by data $(a_r, b_r, c_r)$ a triple of integers, for each residue class
$r~0\bmod~m)$. Given an input integer $x$, the OLOA does the following in one
step. It finds $x \equiv r ~(\bmod~m)$ and based on the value of $r$, it does
the following. If $c_r=0$, the machine halts and outputs $x$, calling it a final
number, If $c_r \ne 0$ it computes to $(a_r x + b_r ~\mbox{DIV} ~c_r= \frac{a_r
x + b_r}{c_r}$, and outputs this value, provided this output is a nonnegative
integer. If $\frac{a_r x + b_r}{c_r}$ is a non-integer or is negative, the the
number $x$ is called a terminal number, and the machine stops. An OLOA $L$
computes a partially defined function $m \to f_{L}(m)$ as follows. For initial
input value $m$, the OLOA is iterated, and halts with $f_{L}(m)=x$ if $x$ is a
final number. Otherwise $f_{L}(m)= \uparrow$ is viewed as undefined, and this
occurs if the computation either reaches a terminal number or else runs for an
infinite number of steps without stopping. The author observes that the $3x+1$
problem can be encoded as an OLOA $L$ with modulus $m=30.$ The increase of
modulus of the $3x+1$ function from $m=2$ to $m=30$ is made in order to encode
the $3x+1$ iteration arriving at value $1$ as a halting state in the sense
above. The $3x+1$ function input $n$ is encoded as the integer $m= 5\cdot
2^{n-1}$ to the OLOA. It is not known if the function $f_L$ computed by this
OLOA has a recursive domain $D(f_L)$, but if the $3x+1$ conjecture is true, then
$D(F_L) = \NN$ will be recursive. The main result of the paper is that there
exists an OLOA $L$ with modulus $m=396$ which is a universal OLOA, i.e. there
exists a unary recursive function $d$ such that $d f_{L}$ is a universal unary
recursive function. Here a unary partial recursive function $u$ is {\em
universal} it there exists some binary recursive function $c$ such that $F_x(y)=
u c(x,y)$ where $F_x(y)$ is an encoding of the $x$-th function in an encoding of
all unary partial recursive function, evaluated at input $y$. In particular this
machine $L$ has an unsolvable halting problem, i.e. the function $f_L$ has
domain $D(f_L)$ which is not recursive. The encoding of the construction uses
some ideas from Minsky machines, as in Conway (1972). The construction of Conway
would give a universal OLOA with a much larger modulus.}

\hspace*{.25in}
This interesting paper describes how to do arithmetic in certain symbolic
logical systems developed by  G. Spencer Brown, {\em Laws of Form},
George Unwin \& Brown: London 1969. Spencer-Brown's  formal system starts from a primitive
notion of the additive void $0$ and the multiplicative void $1$,
and uses division of space by boundaries to create numbers,
which are defined using
certain transformation rules defining equivalent 
expressions. Kauffman argues that these rules give operations more primitive than addition
and multiplication. He develops  a formal natural number  arithmetic in this context,
specifying replacement rules for rearrangements of symbolic expressions,
and gives a proof of consistency of value (Theorem, p. 27).

In Appendix A he presents a second symbolic system, called {\em string arithmetic}.
He discusses the $3x+1$ problem in this context. This system has 
three kinds of  symbols $\ast, \langle, \rangle$, where in representing integers the angles occur only in 
matching pairs. The integer $N$ is represented in unary as a string
of $N$ asterisks. This integer
 has alternate expressions, in which  the angles encode multiplication by $2$.
 Addition is given by concatenation of expressions. 
The transformation rules between equivalent expressions are, if
$W$ is any string of symbols
\begin{eqnarray*}
\ast \ast &\longleftrightarrow & \langle \ast \rangle \\
\rangle \langle &\longleftrightarrow &  (\mbox{blank}) \\
\ast W &\longleftrightarrow &  W \ast
\end{eqnarray*}
A natural number can be defined as any string $W$ equivalent under these rules to some
string of asterisks. 
For examples, these rules give as equivalent representations of $N=4$:
$$
 \ast \ast \ast \ast = \langle \ast \rangle \langle \ast \rangle = \langle \ast \ast \rangle = 
\langle \langle \ast \rangle \rangle.
$$
He observes that the $3x+1$ problem is  particularly simple
to formulate in this system. He gives transformation rules defining the two steps in
the $3x+1$ function. 
If $N = \langle W\rangle$, then it is even, and then $\frac{N}{2}= W$, while if
$N =  \langle W\rangle \ast$,  then it is odd and $\frac{3N+1}{2} = \langle W \ast \rangle W$.
These give the transformation rules
$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
(T1): &~~~~~& \langle W \rangle & \mapsto &W\\
~~~~~~~~~~\\
(T2): & ~~~~~&\langle W \rangle \ast & \mapsto & \langle W \ast \rangle W
\end{array}
$$
The $3x+1$ Conjecture is equivalent to the assertion:
starting from a string of  asterisks of any length, and using the
transformation rules plus the rules (T1) and (T2), one can reach the string
of one asterisk $\ast$. Kauffman says: "A more mystical reason for writing the
Collatz [problem] in string arithmetic is the hope that there is some subtle pattern
right in the notation of string arithmetic that will show the secrets of the iteration."

The author conjectures that for each odd $p$ there is a

convergent of the continued fraction
expansion of $\gamma_p :=\frac{\log (p-1) - \log p}{\log p - \log (p-1)}.$
For $p=7$ these denominators start 
$\Lambda(7) =\{ 1, 2, 13, 28, 265, 293, ...\}$. He finds that $g_7$

This  paper studies sets of integers that are closed under the iteration of

all maps $f_i(x)= m x + a_i$ are expanding maps with the same ratio $m \ge 2$.
The problem is reduced to the study of sets $S(c) = \langle f_1, ..., f_k: c\rangle$ which
denotes the closure under iteration of of these maps starting from a
 single seed element $c$.
The {\em density} $\delta(S)$ of a sequence of nonnegative integers is

If $k=m$ and the semigroup of affine maps having generators  $A:=\{ f_i: 1 \le i \le m\}$

while if this semigroup is free on $k$ generators, then they have positive density.
The paper gives an algorithm to determine whether a sequence $S(c)$ has

{\em A sufficient condition for certain semigroups to be free,}
Journal of Algebra {\bf 74} (1982), 140--148. (MR 83e:10081) \\
\newline
\hspace*{.25in}
This  paper studies sets of integers that are closed under the iteration of
certain one variable affine maps $f_i(x) = a_i x + b_i$, where $a_i, b_i$
are integers with $a_i \ge 2$. It determines sufficient conditions for the
semigroup generated by the maps $f_i$ under composition to be a free
semigroup. 
As motivation, it mentions the Erd\"{o}s problem asking whether the
set of integers generated starting from seed $S= \{ 1\}$ by the maps
$f_1(x) = 2x+1, \, f_2(x)= 3x+1$ and $f_3(x) = 6x+1$ is of positive density.
This problem was solved by D. J. Crampin and A. J. W. Hilton (unpublished)
who observed the density must be zero using the
fact that  the semigroup generated by these functions is not free. 
The paper Klarner (1981) gives an effective algorithm for the case when
all $a_i$ are equal to an integer $m \ge 2$. 
This paper first observes that a
necessary condition for freeness is that
$
\frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{a_k} \le 1.
$
It next supposes the functions are ordered so that the quantities
$p_j = \frac{b_j}{a_j -1}$  satisfy
$ p_1 \le  p_2 \le \cdots \le p_j.$
Here it notes  that strict inequalities are needed for
freeness because  an equality  $p_j=p_{j+1}$  implies 
that the generators $f_j$ and $f_{j+1}$  commute, giving a nontrivial relation.
A sufficient condition for freeness  
is  that on each collection $L(i_1, ..., i_k)$
 of compositions using exactly   $i_j$ generators of type $j$
the linear ordering of all these functions evaluated at $0$ coincides with the lexicographic
ordering  induced on functional composition,
ordering the  generators as  $f_1 < f_2 < \cdots < f_k$.
Theorem 2.1 characterizes
the latter condition, showing that   
these two orderings coincide if and only if,
 the $p_j$ satisfy the two conditions
(i) $p_1< p_2 < \cdots < p_k$
and, (ii) 
$\frac{p_k + b_j}{a_j} \le \frac{p_1+ b_{j+1}}{a_{j+1}}$ holds for $1 \le j \le k-1$. 
It then deduces some examples where the semigroups are free. 
These include $f_1(x) = 2x+ b_1, \, f_2(x) = 3x+ b_2, \, f_3(x) = 6x+ b_3)$
for  the six cases $(b_1, b_2, b_3) = (0, 3, 10), \, (0, 2, 3), \, (2, 0, 15), \, (1, 0, 2), \, (2, 1, 0), \,$

integers with $a_i \ge 2$. It determines sufficient conditions for the semigroup
generated by the maps $f_i$ under composition to be a free semigroup. As
motivation, it mentions the Erd\"{o}s problem asking whether the set of integers
generated starting from seed $S= \{ 1\}$ by the maps $f_1(x) = 2x+1, \, f_2(x)=
3x+1$ and $f_3(x) = 6x+1$ is of positive density. This problem was solved by D.
J. Crampin and A. J. W. Hilton (unpublished) who observed the density must be
zero using the fact that the semigroup generated by these functions is not free.
The paper Klarner (1981) gives an effective algorithm for the case when all
$a_i$ are equal to an integer $m \ge 2$. This paper first observes that a
necessary condition for freeness is that $ \frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} +
\cdots + \frac{1}{a_k} \le 1. $ It next supposes the functions are ordered so
that the quantities $p_j = \frac{b_j}{a_j -1}$ satisfy $ p_1 \le p_2 \le \cdots
\le p_j.$ Here it notes that strict inequalities are needed for freeness because
an equality $p_j=p_{j+1}$ implies that the generators $f_j$ and $f_{j+1}$
commute, giving a nontrivial relation. A sufficient condition for freeness is
that on each collection $L(i_1, ..., i_k)$ of compositions using exactly $i_j$
generators of type $j$ the linear ordering of all these functions evaluated at
$0$ coincides with the lexicographic ordering induced on functional composition,
ordering the generators as $f_1 < f_2 < \cdots < f_k$. Theorem 2.1 characterizes
the latter condition, showing that these two orderings coincide if and only if,
the $p_j$ satisfy the two conditions (i) $p_1< p_2 < \cdots < p_k$ and, (ii)
$\frac{p_k + b_j}{a_j} \le \frac{p_1+ b_{j+1}}{a_{j+1}}$ holds for $1 \le j \le
k-1$. It then deduces some examples where the semigroups are free. These include
$f_1(x) = 2x+ b_1, \, f_2(x) = 3x+ b_2, \, f_3(x) = 6x+ b_3)$ for the six cases
$(b_1, b_2, b_3) = (0, 3, 10), \, (0, 2, 3), \, (2, 0, 15), \, (1, 0, 2), \, (2,
1, 0), \,$ and $(1, 6, 0)$. The second of these cases gives the functions $2x,

This  paper studies sets of integers $T$ that are closed under the iteration of
certain one variable affine maps. It assumes that all maps have the
special form $f_i(x) = m^{e_i} x + a_i, $ all with the same $m \ge 2$,
with all $e_i \ge 1, a_i \ge 0$. The author writes $T = \langle  A: S \rangle$, where
$A $ denotes the finite set of maps and $S$ a finite set of  ``seeds". 
The main idea of the paper is to study the base $m$-representations of
the integers and to show these are described by languages accepted
by a finite automaton; such sets are called here {\em $m$-recognizable.}
This is the content of Theorem 1. This is exhibited
on the example $f_1(x) = 3x, \, f_2(x)= 3x+1, \, f_3(x)= 3x+4.$
Theorem 2 asserts that if $S$ is an $m$-recognizable set, then so
is $T= \langle A: S \rangle$. Theorem 3 asserts that if $T$ is $m$-recognizable so is
the translated set $T+h$.

At the end of the paper more general cases are discussed. He remarks that for 
 $f_1(x) = 2x+1, \, f_2(x) = 3x+1, \, f_3(x) = 6x+1$ with $S= \{ 1\}$, 
suggested by Erd\H{o}s, 
the set $T = <A: S>$ has no discernible structure,  and that Erd\H{o}s
showed that  $T$ contains no infinite arithmetic progression.
He mentions that  Crampin and A. W. S. Hilton (unpublished) 
showed  that this sequence has
(lower asymptotic) density zero, 
answering a question of Erd\H{o}s. 
They used  the existence of  the  nontrivial relation under composition 
$$
f_1 \circ f_1 \circ f_2 = f_3 \circ f_1= 12x+7,
$$
of these affine functions, so that 
$A$ is not a free semigroup under composition in
this case. Klarner also  notes that for the functions considered in this paper there is
an effective algorithm to test whether the resulting set has density zero,
generalizing results in Klarner (1981).

{\em Note.} This paper shows  these sets are {\em $m$-automatic sequences}, in
the terminology of

This  paper studies 
the smallest set of nonnegative
integers obtained from a given set $A$ under iteration of a finite set $R$ of affine
maps 
$$\rho(x_1, ..., x_r)= m_0 + m_1 x_1 + \cdots + m_r x_r,
$$
in which all  $m_i$ are integers, and $m_i \ge 0$ for $i \ge 1$.
They denote  this set $\langle R: A \rangle$. One can now ask questions
concerning  the size and structure of this
set.  This paper gives some sufficient conditions for such a set to be a finite
union of arithmetic progressions, which are called {\em per-sets}; such sets  
necessarily have positive
density. Theorem 4 shows that if $A$ is already a per-set,
then closure under a map having greatest common divisor $(m_1, ..., m_r)=1$
will give a per-set. 
Theorem 5 gives a general condition for a set $<R: A>$ to be closed
under multiplication. 
Conjecture 1 states  that if  $R$ includes
a function having  greatest common divisor $(m_1, ..., m_r)=1$, and $A= \{1\}$ 
then $<R: A>$ is a per-set. 
(The paper also announces a subsequent proof by Klarner of this conjecture; this was 
carried out  in Hoffman and Klarner (1978), (1979).) 
Conjecture 1 is proved here in some cases, showing (Theorem 11) that 
$\langle 2x+ny: 1 \rangle$ is a per-set for
all odd integers $n \ge 1$. Conjecture 2 asserts  that  for all $m,n \ge 1$ the set $<mx+ny: 1>$ 
contains a non-empty per-set. 
 In the case of one variable functions $R= \{ a_1 x + b_1, ..., a_r x+ b_r\}$
it includes a theorem of Erd\H{o}s (Theorem 8) showing that
 if $\sum \frac{1}{a_i}<1$, then the set has density $0$. The authors mention
 numerical study of the set $S= \langle  2x+1, 3x+1: 1 \rangle $, which has density $0$.
 Here Klarner (1972) had conjectured that the complement $\NN \smallsetminus S$  could
 be written as a disjoint union of infinite arithmetic progressions; this was
  proved by Coppersmith (1975).

This paper shows that the iterates of the Collatz function $C(x)$ can
actually be encoded in a simple way by a one-dimensional nearest-neighbor
cellular automaton with 7 states.
The automaton encodes the iterates of the function $C(x)$
written in base 6.
The encoding is possible
because the map $x  \rightarrow  3x +  1$ in base 6 does not have 
carries propagate.
(Compare the $C(x)$-iterates of $x =  26$ and $x =  27$ in base 6.)
The $3x  +  1$ Conjecture is reformulated in terms of special

This paper
shows that the number of integers $ \leq  x$ for which the $3x  +  1$
function has an iterate that is 1 is at least $x^{3/7}$.
More generally, if 
$\theta_a (x) =  \{ n \leq  x : ~  {\rm some}~ T^{(k)} (n) =  a \}$, 
then he shows that, for $a \not\equiv 0~~(\bmod~3)$, 
$\theta_a (x)$ contains at least
$x^{3/7}$ elements, for large enough $x$.
For each fixed $k \ge 2$
this  paper derives a system  of difference inequalities 
based on information $(\bmod~ 3^k)$. The bound $x^{3/7}$
was obtained using $k=2$, and by using larger
values of $k$ better exponents can be obtained.

Annals of Applied Probability {\bf 2} (1992), 229--261.
(MR 92k:60159). \\
\newline
\hspace*{.25in}
This paper studies two stochastic models that mimic the ``pseudorandom''
behavior of the $3x  +  1$ function. The models are branching
random walks, and the analysis uses the theory of large
deviations.

For the models  the
average number of steps to get to $1$ is $\alpha_0 \log n$,
where
$\alpha_0 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \log \frac{3}{4}\right)^{-1}\approx 6.9$
For both models it is shown that there is a constant
$c_0 =  41.677. . .$ such that with probability one
for any $\epsilon  >  0$ only finitely many $m$
take $(c_0  +  \epsilon )  \log m$ iterations to take the value 1,
while infinitely many $m$ take at least 
$(c_0  -  \epsilon )  \log  m$ iterations
to do so.
This prediction is shown to be consistent with empirical data 
for the $3x  +  1$ function.

The paper also studies the maximum excursion
$$
t(n) : = \max_{k \geq 1} T^{(k)} (n)
$$
and conjectures that $t(n) < n^{2+o(1)}$ as $n \to \infty$.
An analog of this conjecture is proved for one
stochastic model.
The conjecture $t(n) \leq n^{2 + o(1)}$ is consistent with empirical
data of Leavens and Vermeulen (1992) for
$n < 10^{12}$.

This paper considers mappings $T(x) = \frac  {m_i  x  -  r_i }{d}$ if
$x  \equiv  i~ (\bmod  ~d)$, where all
$r_i  \equiv  im_i~ (\bmod  ~d$). This work is motivated by earlier
work of Matthews and Watts (1984), (1985), and introduces
significant new ideas. 

Given such a mapping $T$
and an auxiliary modulus $m$ it introduces two Markov chains, denoted $\{X_n\}$ and $\{Y_n\}$,
%(depending on $(T, m)$) 
whose behavior encodes information on the iterates of $T$ (modulo $md^k$) for all
$k \ge 1$. In general, both Markov chains have a countable number of states; however
in many interesting cases both these chains are   finite state Markov chains. The states
of each chain are labelled by certain congruence classes 
$B(x_j, M_j):= \{ x: x \equiv x_j (\bmod~M_j)\}$ with $M_j | m d^k$ for some $k \ge 1$.
(In particular $B(x_j, M_j) \subset B(x_k, M_k)$ may occur.) Any finite path in such a  chain can be realized by a sequence of iterates
$x_j= T^{j}(x_0)$ for some  $x_0 \in \ZZ$ satisfying the congruences specified by the states. 
The author shows the two chains contain equivalent information; the chain $\{ X_n\}$ has
in general fewer states than the chain $\{Y_n\}$ but the latter is more suitable for
theoretical analysis, in particular one chain is finite if and only if the other one is.  
If such a  chain has a positive ergodic class of states, then the limiting frequency distribution of
state occupation of a path in the chain in this class exists, and from this
the corresponding frequencies of iterates  
 in a given congruence class (mod $m$) can be calculated (Theorem 1-  Theorem 4).  
 
 For applications to the map $T$ on the integers, the
  author 's guiding conjecture is: {\em any condition that occurs with probability zero in the
 Markov chain model does not occur in divergent trajectories on $T$.}
Thus the author conjectures  that in cases where the Markov chain is finite,  there are 
limiting densities that
divergent trajectories for $T$ (should they exist) spend in each residue class 
$j$ $(\bmod  ~m)$, obtained from frequency distribution in ergodic states
of the chain. 

The author gets a complete analysis whenever the associated Markov
chains are finite.  Furthermore Theorem 7
shows that any map $T$ satisfying the condition 
$gcd(m_i, d^2) = gcd(m_i, d)$ for $0 \le i \le d-1$,
has, for every modulus $m$,
 both Markov chains $\{X_n\}$ and $\{Y_n\}$ 
being  finite chains.  All  maps studied in  the earlier work of Matthews and Watts (1984, 1985)
satisfy this condition, and the author  recovers nearly all of their results in 
these cases.  
 

In Sect. 5 the author suggests that  when infinite Markov chains occur, that one 
approximate them using  
a series of larger and larger finite Markov chains obtained by truncation.
Conjecture 2  predicts limiting frequencies of iterates (mod $m$) for the map $T$,
even in these cases.
The paper concludes with several worked examples. 

This Markov chain approach was extended further by  Venturini (1992).

This paper studies the class of entire functions
$$
f_h(z) := \frac{z}{2} + (z + \frac{1}{2})(\frac{1 + \cos \pi z}{2})
 + \frac{1}{\pi}(\frac{1}{2} - \cos \pi z) \sin \pi z
 + h(z) (\sin \pi z)^2,
$$
in which $h(z)$ is an arbitrary entire function. Each function in this
class reproduces the $3x+1$-function on the integers, and the set of
integers is contained in the set of critical points of the function.
The simplest such function takes $h(z)$ to be identically zero, and is
denoted $f_0(z)$. The authors study the iteration properties of this
map in the complex plane $\CC.$ They show that $\ZZ$ is contained in
the Fatou set of $f_h(z)$. There is a classification of the connected
components of
the Fatou set of an entire function into six categories: (1) (periodic)
immediate basins of (super-) attracting periodic points, (2) (periodic)
immediate basins of attraction of rationally indifferent periodic points,
(3) (periodic) Siegel disks, (4) periodic domains at infinity (Baker domains), (5) preperiodic 
components of any of the above, and (6) wandering domains.
The following results all apply to the function $f_0(z)$, and some of them
are proved for more general $f_h(z)$.
The Fatou component of any integer must be in the basin of attraction
of a superattracting periodic point or be in a wandering domain; the authors
conjecture the latter does not happen.
The existence
of a divergent trajectory is shown equivalent to $f_0(z)$ containing
a wandering domain containing some
integer. No two integers are in the same
Fatou component, except possibly $-1$ and $-2$. The
real axis contains points of the Julia set between any two integers,
except possibly $-1$ and $-2$.
It is known that  holomorphic dynamics of an entire function $f$ 
is controlled by its critical points. The critical points of $f_0(z)$ on
the real axis consist of the integers together with $-\frac{1}{2}$.
The authors would like to choose $h$ to reduce the number of other
critical points, to simplify the dynamics. However they show that
any map $f_h(z)$ must contain at least one more critical point in addition to
the critical points on the real axis (and presumably infinitely many.)
The authors compare and contrast their results with the real dynamics studied
in Chamberland (1996).

A $Z$-number is a real number $\xi$ such that
$0 \le {{ (\frac{3}{2})^k \xi }} \le \frac{1}{2}$
holds for all $k \ge 1$, where ${{x}}$ denotes the fractional
part of $x$. Do $Z$-numbers exist?
The $Z$-number problem  was originally
proposed by Prof. Saburo Uchiyama (Tsukuba Univ.)
according to S. Ando (personal communication),
and was motivated by a connection with the
function $g(k)$ in Waring's problem, for which
see G. H. Hardy and E. M. Wright , {An Introduction to the
Theory of Numbers} (4-th edition), Oxford Univ. Press 1960,
Theorem 393 ff. and Stemmler (1964).

Mahler shows that
existence of $Z$-numbers relates to a question concerning
the iteration of the function
$$
g(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\df{3x+1}{2} & \mbox{if} ~~x \equiv 1~~ (\bmod~2) ~. \\
~~~ \\
\df{3x}{2} & \mbox{if}  ~~x \equiv 0~~ (\bmod~2)~.
\end{array}
\right.
$$
Mahler showed that a  $Z$-number exists in the
interval $[n, n+1)$ if and only if no iterate
$g^{(k)}(n) \equiv 3 ~(\bmod~4).$ He uses 
this relation to prove  that
the number of $Z$-numbers below $x$ is at most $O(x^{0.7}).$
He conjecures that no  $Z$-numbers exist, a problem which is
still unsolved. 

{\em Note.} Leopold Flatto (1992)   subsequently improved
Mahler's upper bound on $Z$-numbers below $x$ to $O(x^{\theta})$,
with $\theta = \log_2 \frac{3}{2} \approx 0.59$.

DATALOG is the language of logic programs without

set of Horn clauses in the language of first order
logic without equality and without functions.

The author introduces {\em Achilles-Turtle
machines}, which model the iteration of 
{\em Conway functions},  as introduced in Conway (1972).
These are functions $g: \NN \to \NN$ having the form
$$
g(n) = \frac{a_j}{q_j} n 
~~\mbox{~if~} n \equiv j (\bmod~p),~ 0 \le j \le p - 1,
$$
where for each $j$,  $a_j \ge 0,  q_j\ge 1$ are integers 
with  $q_j | gcd (j, p)$ and with $\frac{a_j}{q_j} \le p$.
He cites Devienne, Leb\'{e}gue and Routier (1993)
for the idea of relating Conway functions 
to Horn clauses. In Section 2.3 
he explicitly describes  an
Achilles-Turtle machine associated to computing the Collatz 
function. 

The paper proves that several questions concerning
the uniform boundedness of computations are undecidable.
These include uniform boundedness for ternary linear programs;
unfiorm boundedness for single recursive rule ternary
programs; and uniform boundedness of single rule programs.
These results give no information regarding the $3x+1$ function

This paper studies maps of the form
$$

$$
These extend first to maps on the $d$-adic integers $\ZZ_d$,
and then further to maps on the polyadic integers $\hat{\ZZ}$.
Here $\hat{\ZZ}$ is the projective limit of the set of
homomorphisms $\phi_{n,m} : \ZZ  \rightarrow  \ZZ /m \ZZ$ where $m | n $.
The open sets $B(j,m) $ $: = \{ x \in \hat{\ZZ} : x \equiv j (  \bmod~m)\} $
put a topology on $\hat{\ZZ}$, which has a Haar measure 
$\sigma ( B( j,m)) = \frac{ 1}{m}$.
The paper proves conjectures of Buttsworth and Matthews (1990) 
on the structure
of all ergodic open sets $( \bmod~m)$.
In particular the ergodic sets link together to give finitely many
projective systems, each giving $T$-invariant measure on $\hat{\ZZ}$.
The paper gives examples where there are infinitely many ergodic sets.

The author studies cycles for the $3x+1$ map, and more generally
considers the $bx+1$ map for odd $b$.
 He exhibits a cycle for the $5x+1$ that does not contain $1$, namely
$n=13$.  He obtains a general formula (4.1) for a rational number $a$ to be in a  cycle
of the $3x+1$ map, as in Lagarias (1990).
At the end  of the paper  is a theorem asserting  that the only cycle of the Collatz map acting on
the positive integers is the trivial cycle $\{ 1, 2, 4\}$.
 The proof of this theorem has a gap, however. The author 
points this out in the addendum, and says he hopes to return to the question in
future papers. 

The author's approach  to proving that the trivial cycle is the
only cycle on the positive integers is as follows. He observes that the condition (4.1) for $c$
to be a rational cycle with $\nu$ odd elements can be rewritten as 
$$
c= \frac{A_{\nu} + x_0^{\ast}}{A_{\nu} + y_0^{\ast}}
$$
for certain integers $(x_0^{\ast}, y_0^{\ast})$, 
taking $A_{\nu}=2^{2\nu} - 3^{\nu}$.
%3^{\nu -1} + 3^{\nu-2} 2^2 + \cdots + 3^0 2^{2\nu -2} = 2^{2\nu} - 3^{\nu}$.
He then observes that this can be viewed as  a  
special case of a linear Diophantine equation in $(x,y)$, 
$$
c= \frac{A_{\nu} + x}{A_{\nu} + y}, ~~~~\mbox{with}~~A, c~\mbox{fixed}, 
$$
which has the  general solution $(x, y) = ( (c^2-1)A + \lambda c, (c-1)A + \lambda c)$, for
some integer $\lambda$. His proof   shows that the case where $(x_0^{\ast}, y_0^{\ast})$
has associated value  $\lambda=0$ leads to a contradiction. The gap in the proof is
that cases where $\lambda \ne 0$ are not ruled out.

The Busy Beaver problem is to find that Turing machine
which, among all $k$-state Turing machines, when given the

The function $\Sigma (k)$ is well-known to be non-recursive.
This paper shows that the current Busy Beaver record-holder for 
5-state Turing
machine computes a Collatz-like function.
This machine $M_5$ of Marxen and Buntrock [Bulletin EATCS No.

$g(3m + 1) =  5m + 9$, $g(3m+2) =  \uparrow$ eventually halts at

Similar results are proved for several other 5-state Turing machines.
The result of Mahler [J. Aust. Math. Soc.

If a $Z$-number exists then there is an input $m_0$

$g(4m~+~ 1) =  6m~+~ 2$,
$g(4m~+~ 3) =  \uparrow$

For real $\beta  >  1$, define the function 
$T_\beta : \NN  \rightarrow  \NN$ by
$$
T_\beta (n) =  \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lceil \beta n \rceil & \mbox{if}~n \equiv 1~~(\bmod~2 ) \\
~~~ \\
\df{n}{2} & \mbox{if $n \equiv 0~~(\bmod~2 ) ~.$}
\end{array}
\right.
$$
Then $\beta =  \frac{3}{2}$ gives the
$(3x  +  1)$-function.
Conjecture $C_\beta$ asserts that $T_\beta$ has finitely many cycles and
every $n  \in  \NN$ eventually enters a cycle under iteration of $T_\beta$.
The author shows that, for any fixed $0 < \epsilon < 1$, and for $\beta$
either transcendental or rational with an even denominator, if 
$1 < \beta < 2$,
then the set 
$S( \epsilon , \beta) = \{ n:$ some $T_\beta^{(k)} (n) < \epsilon n \}$
has natural density one, while if $\beta  >  2$
then $S^\ast ( \epsilon , \beta ) = \{  n :$ some 
$T_\beta^{(k)} (n)  >  \epsilon^{-1} n \}$
has natural density one.
For certain algebraic $\beta$ different behavior may occur,
and Conjecture $C_\beta$ can sometimes be settled.
In particular Conjecture $C_\beta$ is true for $\beta =  \sqrt 2$
and false for $\beta = \frac{1  +  \sqrt 5}{2}$.

The paper argues there is a  strong connection between mathematics
education and computers. It points out that mathematics is an
experimental science. In an appendix the  $3x+1$ problem is formulated 
as an example for experimentation, and a number of its properties are derived. 
The author
formulates the $3x+1$ conjecture, says he does not know the answer,
but that it can be numerically studied.
For the Collatz function he gives a heuristic that predicts that the number of elements that
take exactly $s$ steps to iterate to $1$ should grow like $\alpha^s$,
with $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \sqrt{\frac{7}{3}}\right) \approx 1.26376.$

This paper studies the structure of forward and backward iterates
of the $3x+1$ problem, treating the iteration as proceeding from one
odd integer to the next odd iterate.
It obtains necessary conditions  for existence of a
nontrivial cycle in the $3x+1$ problem. It observes
that if $(D_1, ..., D_n)$ are the odd integers in such a cycle, then
$$
\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{3D_i+1}{D_i} = 2^{e_1+ \cdots+ e_n} = 2^k.
$$
If the $3x+1$ conjecture is verified up to $D$ then $\frac{3D+1}{D} > \frac{3D_i+1}{D_i}$, for all $i$, whence
$$
n \log_2 (\frac{3D+1}{2}) > k > n \log_2 3.
$$
They conclude that there must be an integer in the interval
$[n \log_2 (\frac{3D+1}{2}) , n \log_2 3]$, a condition which imposes a lower bound on $n$, 
the number of odd integers in the cycle. In fact one must have 
$k = 1+ \lfloor n \log_2 3 \rfloor,$ 
and $Max_{i}\{  D_{i} \}> (2^{\frac{k}{n}} -3)^{-1},$  
and $\frac{k}{n}$ is a good rational approximation to $\log_2 3$.
Using the continued fraction expansion of
$\log_2 3$, including the intermediate convergents, the authors conclude
that  if the $3x+1$ conjecture
is verified for all integers up to $D=2^{40}+1$,
then  one may conclude $n \ge 1078215.$

The paper also investigates 
the numbers $M(N,n)$ of parity-sequences of length $N$ which
contain $n$ odd values, at positions $k_1, k_2, ..., k_n$ with $k_n=N$, and such that
the partial sums $h_j=k_1+k_2 +\cdots+ k_j$ with all $h_j \le L_j := \lfloor j \log_2 3\rfloor$.
Here $\log_2 (3) \approx 1.585$. 
%They set $Q_{N,n}= \frac{1}{2^N} M(N,n)$.
These are the possible candidate
 initial parity sequences for the smallest positive number in a nontrivial cycle
of the $3x+1$ iteration of period $N$ or longer. 



 
{\em Note: }  The method of the authors for getting a lower bound on
the length of nontrivial cycles is similar in
spirit to earlier methods, cf. Eliahou (1993) and Halbeisen and H\"{u}ngerbuhler (1997). 
 Later computations of the authors show that
if one can take $D= 2^{61}+1\approx 2.306 \times 10^{18}$, then one may conclude there
are no nontrivial cycles containing less than
$n=6,586,818,670$ odd integers.
The calculations of T. Olivera e Silva, as of 2008, have verified
the $3x+1$ conjecture to $19 \times 2^{58} \approx 5.476 \times 10^{18}$, so this improved
cycle bound result is now unconditional.

initial parity sequences for the smallest positive number in a nontrivial cycle
of the $3x+1$ iteration of period $N$ or longer. {\em Note: } The method of the
authors for getting a lower bound on the length of nontrivial cycles is similar
in spirit to earlier methods, cf. Eliahou (1993) and Halbeisen and
H\"{u}ngerbuhler (1997). Later computations of the authors show that if one can
take $D= 2^{61}+1\approx 2.306 \times 10^{18}$, then one may conclude there are
no nontrivial cycles containing less than $n=6,586,818,670$ odd integers. The
calculations of T. Olivera e Silva, as of 2008, have verified the $3x+1$
conjecture to $19 \times 2^{58} \approx 5.476 \times 10^{18}$, so this improved
cycle bound result is now unconditional.}

A generalized Collatz
map has the form $T(x)= a_i x + b_i$, for $x \equiv i ~(\bmod~n)$,
in which  $a_i= \frac{\alpha_i}{n}, b_i = \frac{\beta_i}{n}$, with $\alpha_i, \beta_i$
integers satisfying $i\alpha_i + \beta_i \equiv 0~(\bmod~n).$ The authors
note there is  a continuous extension of this map to the real line given by
$$
\hat{T}(x) = \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} (a_m x + b_m)
 \left( \sum_{h=0}^{n-1} e^{\frac{2 \pi ih(m-x)}{n}}\right)
= \sum_{h=0}^{n-1} ( A_h x+ B_h) e^{-\frac{2\pi i hx}{n}},
$$
where $\{A_k\}, \{B_k\}$ are the discrete Fourier transforms of the $\{a_i\},$ res. $\{ b_i\}$.
This permits analysis of the iterations of the map using the 
discrete Fourier transform and its inverse. 

They specialize to the case $n=2$, where the data $(a_0, a_1, b_0, b_1)$
describing $T$ are half-integers, with $b_0$ and $a_1+b_1$ integers.
The  $3x+1$ function corresponds to
$(a_0, a_1, b_0, b_1)= (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, 0, \frac{1}{2})$.
One has  $A_0= \frac{1}{2}(a_0+a_1),
A_1= \frac{1}{2}(a_0-a_1), B_0= \frac{1}{2}(b_0+b_1), B_1= \frac{1}{2}(b_0-b_1).$
The authors note that  the recursion 
$$
x_{k+1}= \hat{T}(x_k)= (A_0 x_k+ B_0) + (A_1 x_k+ B_1) \cos( \pi x_k)
$$
can be transformed into  a two-variable system
 using the auxiliary variable $\xi_k= \cos (\pi x_k)$, as
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_{k+1}&=& (A_0x_k + B_0) + (A_1x_k + B_1) \xi_k\\
\xi_{k+1} & =& \cos \left( \pi(A_0x_k+B_0) + \pi(A_1x_k+ B_1) \xi_k\right).
\end{eqnarray*}
They give a formula for $x_{m}$ in terms of the
data $(x_0, \xi_0, \xi_1, ..., \xi_{m-1})$, namely
$$
x_m = \left(\prod_{j=0}^{m-1}(A_0+ A_1 \xi_j)\right)x_0 + (B_0+\xi_{m-1}B_1)+
\sum_{k=0}^{m-2}(B_0 + \xi_kB_1) \prod_{j=k+1}^{m-1}(A_0+ \xi_k A_1).
$$
Now they study the transformed system  in terms of the auxiliary variables $\xi_j$ .
When the starting values $(x_0, x_1)$ are integers, all subsequent values are integers,
and then the auxiliary variables $\xi_k= \pm 1$. Then the  recursion for $\xi_{k+1}$ above
can be simplified by trigonometric sum of angles formulas. In particular the obtain
recursions for the $\xi_j$ that are  independent of the $x_k's$ whenever  $a_0$ and $a_1$
are both integers, but not otherwise. Finally the authors observe  that  on integer orbits 
$\xi_m$ is a periodic function of $x_0$  (of period dividing $2^{m+1}$) which can
be interpolated using a Fourier series  in $\cos \frac{2\pi h}{2^{m+1}}, \sin \frac{2\pi h}{2^{m+1}}$,
using the inverse discrete Fourier transform. They give explicit  
interpolations for $\xi_m$ for the $3x+1$ function for $m=0, 1, 2.$

For $\alpha, \beta > 1$ let $\gamma$ be

Raymond Queneau (1903-1976) was a French poet and novelist,
and a founding member in 1960 of the
French mathematical-literary group Oulipo (Ouvroir de litt\'{e}rature potentielle).
He was  a member of the mathematical society of France from 1948 on, and published
in 1972 a mathematical paper in additive number theory.
 His final essay in 1976 was titled: ``Les fondaments de la litt\'{e}rature d'apr\`{e}s David Hilbert"
(La Biblioth\`{e}que Oulipienne, No. 3); it set out an axiomatic foundation of  literature in
imitiation of Hilbert's {\em Foundations of Geometry}, replacing ``points", ``straight line", and ``plane"
with ``word" , ``sentence"  and ``paragraph", respectively, in some of Hilbert's axioms.
[English translation: The Foundations of Literature (after David Hilbert),

``THEOREM 7. {\em Between two words of a sentence there exists an infinity of other words.}" To 
explain this result,  he posits the existence of   ``imaginary words." 




This short note is a comment on a preceding article by
A. Taverna, {\em Arnaut Daniel et la Spirale},
Subsidia Pataphysica, No. 1 (1969), 73--78.
Arnaut Daniel was a 12-th century troubadour who
composed poems in Occitan having  a particular rhyming
pattern, called a sestina. Dante admired him and honored
him in several works, including
the {\em Divine Comedy}, where Daniel  is depicted as doing penance in Purgatory
in {\em Purgatorio}. 
The rhyming pattern of the sestina had
six sextets with rhyme pattern involving a cyclic
permutation of order $6$, followed by a triplet.   The work
of Taverna observes that this  cyclic permutation can be represented using a spiral
pattern.   

Queneau considers the ``spiral permutation"  on  numbers $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$
which which takes $2p$ to $p$
and $2p+1$ to $n-p$.
He raises the question: For which $n$ is  a similar spiral permutations
in the symmetric group $S_{n}$ a cyclic permutation?  Call these allowable $n$. 
The example
of the sestina is the case $n=6$; this pattern he terms the sextine.  
He says it is easy to show  that numbers of the form $n= 2xy+x+y$, with $x, y \ge 1$, are not
allowable numbers; this excludes $n=4,7 , 10$ etc.  
He states that  the following $31$ integers $n\le 100$ are allowable:
$n=1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 14, 18, 23, 26,
29, 30, 33, 35, 39, 41, 50, 51, 53, 65, 69, 74, 81, 83, 86, 89, 90, 95,$ \\
$ 98, 99.$

This paper is in the  Oulipo spirit, considering literature obtainable when mathematical
restrictions are placed on its allowable form. Queneau also discussed the 
 topic of  ``Sextines"   in his 1965 essay on
the aims  of  the group Oulipo, 
``Litt\'{e}rature potentielle", published in
{\em B\^{a}tons, chiffres et lettres}, 2nd Edition, Gallimard: Paris 1965.

 R. Queneau, {\em Letters,
Numbers, Forms: Essays 1928--1970} (Jordan Stump, Translator), Univ. of

{\em Note.}  Queneau's question was later formulated as the behavior under
iteration of a $(3x+1)$-like function $\delta_n(x)$ on the range
$x \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$, as observed in Roubaud (1969) and Bringer (1969).
Queneau later published a paper in additive number theory [J. Comb. Theory  A {\bf 12}
 (1972), 31--71], which is on a different topic, but
 mentions in passing   at least one $(3x+1)$-like function  (on page 63).

This is the detailed paper following the announcement
in Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci. Paris (A-B) {\bf 266} (1968), A957--A958.
This paper studies sequences of integers constructed by a
  ``greedy" algorithm, where the first $2s$ integers $0< u_1<u_2< ...,<u_{2s}$ are arbitrary, 
and thereafter each integer $a_t$ is the smallest integer that can be written in
exactly $s$ distinct ways as $S_{ij} = u_i +u_{i+1}+ \cdots + u_j$, for some
$1 \le i < j< t$. He shows that in order for the series not to terminate
the initial set must be a union of two arithmetic progressions of length $s$,

$\{u, 2u, ..., su\}$ and the other $\{ v, v+u, ..., v+ (s-1)u\}$. Letting $S(s,u, v)$
denoting the sequence generated this way, he shows that for $s\ge 2$ and
$u \ge 3$, then the sequence is infinite, consisting of
$\{ v+nu: n \ge s\}$, together with the single term $2v+(2s-1)u$.  He then considers
cases with $s\ge 2$ and $u=1$ or $u=2$. Some sequences of the above form
are finite, and some are infinite; he presents some results and conjectures. For $s=0, 1$ all 
$s$-sequences are infinite, and may have a complicated structure. 

 On page 63 there appears a $3x+1$-like function $\sigma(2p)=p-1, \sigma(2p+1)= p$ of
the form considered in Queneau (1963).

This paper considers work on rhyming patterns in poems suggested
by those of medieval troubadours. The $n$-ine is a generalization
of the rhyme pattern of the sestina of Arnaut Daniel, a 12-th century
troubadour, see Queneau (1963), Roubaud (1969). It considers a
``spiral permutation" of the symmetric group $S_{N}$, which he earlier gave
mathematically as 
$$
\delta_n(x) := \left\{ 
 \begin{array}{cl}
\df{x}{2} & ~~\mbox{if} ~~x  ~~\mbox{is ~even}\\
~&~\\
\df{2n+ 1-x}{2} & ~~\mbox{if} ~~x  ~~\mbox{is ~odd}\\
\end{array}
%\.
\right.
$$
restricted to the domain  $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$.

Roubaud summarizes the work of Bringer (1969) giving restrictions
on admissible $n$. She observed $p=2n+1$ must be prime and
that $2$ is a primitive root of $p$ is a sufficient condition for
admissibility. 
He advances the conjectures that 
the complete set of admissible  $n$ are those with  $p=2n+1$ a 
prime, such that either $ord_p(2)=2n$, so that $2$ is a primitive root, or else 
$ord_p(2)=n$.  (This conjecture later turned out to require a correction;
namely, to allow those $n$ with  $ord_p(2)=n$ only when $n \equiv 3 (\bmod~4)$.) 

Roubaud suggests various generalizations of the problem.
Bringer(1969) had studied the inverse permutation to $\delta_n$, given by
$$
d_n(x) := \left\{ 
 \begin{array}{cl}
2x & ~~\mbox{if} ~~1 \le x \le \frac{n}{2}\\
~&~\\
2n+1-2x & ~~\mbox{if} ~~\frac{n}{2} < x \le n\\
\end{array}
%\.
\right.
$$
In Section 5 Roubaud suggests a generalization of this, to the permutations
$$
d_n(x) := \left\{ 
 \begin{array}{cl}
3x & ~~\mbox{if} ~~1 \le x \le \frac{n}{3}\\
~&~\\
2n+1-3x & ~~\mbox{if} ~~\frac{n}{3} < x \le \frac{2n}{3}\\
~&~\\
3x- (2n+1) & ~~\mbox{if} ~~\frac{2n}{3} < x \le n.\\
\end{array}
%\.
\right.
$$
Here $n=8$ is a solution, and he composes a poem, ``Novembre", a $3$-octine,
to this rhyming pattern, in honor of Raymond Queneau. 
Call these solutions
$3$-admissible, and those of the original problem $2$-admissible. 
He gives the following list of $3$-admissible solutions for $n \le 200$ that are not $2$-admissible:
$n=8, 15, 21, 39, 44, 56, 63, 68, 111, 116, 128, 140, 165, 176, 200.$

He concludes with some other proposed
rhyming schemes involving spirals, including the ``spinine", also called  ``escargonine".

This note gives comments on Problem $63-13^{*}$,
proposed by   Klamkin (1963). This 
problem concerns the
iteration of Collatz's original function, which
is a permutation of the integers.
He states that these problems date back at least
to 1950,  when L. Collatz mentioned them in
personal conversations at the  International
Math. Congress held  at Harvard University.
He gives the results of a computer search of the orbit of
$8$ for Collatz's original function, observing
that it reaches numbers larger than $10^{10}.$
 He observes there are known cycles of length 
$1$, $2$, $5$ and $12$, the last having
smallest element $n=144$. He observes that
this seems related to the fact that the
continued fraction expansion of $\log_2 3$
has initial convergents  having denominators
$1$, $2$, $5$, $12$, $41$, ...
However he does not know of any  cycle of period $41$. He
notes that it is not  known whether the only cycle lengths
that can occur must be denominators of such
partial quotients. Later Atkin (1966) proved
there exists no cycle of period $41$.

The problem concerns iteration of the Collatz function
$C(n)$. Let $l(n)$ count the number of distinct integers
appearing in the sequence of iterates $C^{(k)}(n)$, $k \ge 1$, 
assuming it eventually enters a cycle.
Thus $l(1) = 3, l(2)=3, l(3) = 8$, for example. Set
$S(N) = \sum_{n=1}^N l(n)$. The problem asks 
whether it is  true that
$$
S(N) = A N \log N + B N + o(N) ~~\mbox{as}~~ N \to \infty,
$$
where
$$ A = \frac{3}{2} \log \frac{4}{3} \approx 5.21409 \mbox{~and~}
B = A(1 - \log 2) \approx 1.59996.
$$

In order for $S(N)$ to
remain finite, there must be no divergent trajectories.
This problem formalizes the result of a heuristic
probabilistic calculation based on assuming the
$3x+1$ Conjecture to be true.

This paper studies periodic orbits of the
$3x+1$ map, and a
problem raised by Davidson (1976).
 A sequence of iterates  $\{n_1, n_2, ... , n_p, n_{p+1}\}$ 
with $T(n_j) = n_{j+1}$ is called by Davidson (1977) a
{\em circuit} if it consists of a sequence of
odd integers $\{n_1, n_2,..., n_j\}$ followed by a sequence
of even integers $\{n_{j+1}, n_{j+2}, ..., n_p\}$,
with $n_{p+1} = T(n_p)$ an odd integer.
A circuit is a {\em cycle} if $n_{p+1} = n_1$.

This paper shows that  the only  circuit on
the positive integers that is a cycle is $\{1, 2\}$.
It uses the observation of Davison (1977) 
that these corresponds to positive solutions $(k, l, h)$ 
to the exponential Diophantine equation
$$ 
(2^{k+l} - 3^k)h = 2^l - 1.
$$
The paper  shows that the only solution to this equation
in positive integers is  $(k, l, h) = (1,1,1)$.
The proof  uses results from transcendence theory, 
Baker's method of linear forms in logarithms
(see A. Baker, {\em Transcendental Number Theory},
Cambridge Univ. Press 1975, p. 45.) 


[One could prove similarly that there are exactly three
circuits that are cycles on the non-positive integers,
namely  $\{-1\}$, and $\{ -5, -7, -10\}$.
These correspond to the solutions to the exponential
Diophantine equation 
 $(k, l, h) =  (k, 0, 0)$ for any $k \ge 1$; and $ (2,1,-1)$,
respectively. A further solution  $(0, 2, 1)$
corresponds to the cycle $\{0\}$ which is not a circuit
by the definition above. ]

This paper studies a purportedly ``simpler''
analogue of the $3x+1$ function.
Let $\phi = \frac{1+ \sqrt 5}{2}$.
The function $f: \ZZ^+ \rightarrow \ZZ^+$
is given by
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
f( \lfloor n \phi \rfloor ) = \lfloor n \phi^2 \rfloor +2~,  
& \mbox{all} ~~ n \geq 1 ~, \\
~~~ \\
f ( \lfloor n \phi^2 \rfloor )  =  n~. & \mbox{all} ~~ n \geq 1 ~.
\end{array}
\right.
$$
This function is well-defined because the sets
$A = \{ \lfloor n \phi \rfloor : n \geq 1 \}$ and
$B = \{ \lfloor n \phi^2 \rfloor : n \geq 1 \}$
form a partition of the positive
integers.
(This is a special case of Beatty's theorem.)
The function $f$ is analogous to the $3x+1$ function in that it is
increasing on the domain $A$ and decreasing on the
domain $B$.
The paper shows that almost all trajectories diverge to $+ \infty$,
the only exceptions being a certain set $\{3,7,18,47, \ldots \}$
of density zero which converges to the two-cycle $\{3,7\}$.
Stolarsky determines the
complete symbolic dynamics of $f$.
The possible symbol sequences of orbits are
$B^\ell (AB)^k A^\infty$ for some $\ell , k \geq 0$,
for divergent trajectories, and
$B^\ell (AB)^\infty$ for some $\ell \geq 0$, for
trajectories that reach the two-cycle $\{3,7\}$.

{\em A stopping time problem on the positive integers,}
Acta Arithmetica {\bf 30} (1976), 241--252. 
(MR 58 \#27879). \\

\hspace*{.25in}
This is the first significant research paper 
to appear that deals directly
with the $3x+1$ function. The $3x+1$
function was however the motivation for the paper
Conway (1972).
The main result of this paper was obtained independently 
and contemporaneously  by Everett (1977).

A positive integer $n$ is said to have  
{\em stopping time} $k$ if the $k$-th iterate $T^{(k)}(n) < n,$
and $T^{(j)}(n) \ge n$ for $1 \le j < k$. 
The author shows that the set of integers having
stopping time $k$ forms a set of congruence classes
$(\bmod~ 2^k)$, minus a finite number of elements.
He shows that the set of integers having a  finite
stopping time has natural density one.
Some further 
details of this proof were supplied later in Terras (1979).

This paper introduces the notion of the {\em coefficient
stopping time} $\kappa(n)$ of an integer $n > 1.$
Write  $T^{(k)}(n) = \alpha(n) n + \beta(n)$
with $\alpha(n) = \frac{3^{a(n)}}{2^n}$,
where $a(n)$ is the number of iterates $T^{(j)}(n) \equiv 1 (\bmod~2)$
with $0 \le j < k$.
Then $\kappa(n)$ is 
defined to be the least
$k \ge 1$ such that
$T^{(k)}(n) = \alpha(n) n + \beta(n)$ has $\alpha(n) < 1$,
and  $\kappa(n) =\infty$ if no such value exists.
It is clear that $\kappa(n) \le \sigma(n)$,
where $\sigma(n)$ is the stopping time of $n$.
Terras formulates the {\em Coefficient Stopping Time
Conjecture}, which asserts that $\kappa(n) = \sigma(n)$
for all $n \ge 2$. He proves this conjecture
for all values  $\kappa(n) \le 2593$.
This can be done for  $\kappa(n)$ below a fixed
bound  by upper bounding $\beta(n)$ and showing 
bounding $\kappa(n) < 1 - \delta$ for suitable $\delta$
and determining  the maximal  value $\frac{3^l}{2^j} < 1$
possible with $j$ below the given bound. The 
convergents of the continued
fraction expansion of $\log_2 3$ play a role in 
determining the values of $j$ that must be checked.

Problem 133 is the $3x+1$ problem. 
It was proposed  by K. S. Williams 
(Concordia Univ.), who said that he was shown it by one
of his students. 
C. W. Trigg gives some earlier history of the
problem. He remarks that Richard K. Guy wrote to him stating 
that Lothar Collatz had given a lecture on the problem at Harvard in
1950 (informally at  the International Math. Congress).
He  reported that in 1970 H. S. M. Coxeter offered
a prize of $\$50$ for proving the $3x+1$ Conjecture and 
$\$100$ for finding a counterexample, in his talk:
``Cyclic Sequences and Frieze Patterns''
(The Fourth Felix Behrend Memorial Lecture in Mathematics),
The University of Melbourne,  1970, see Coxeter (1971).
He also referenced  a discussion of the problem in several issues
of {\em Popular Computing} No. 1 (April 1973) 1--2;
No. 4 (July 1973) 6--7; No. 13 (April 1974) 12--13;

Dodge references the work of Isard and Zwicky (1970).

{\em Note.} Lothar Collatz was present at the 1950 ICM

Coxeter, Kakutani and Ulam each delivered a lecture

given $x$ as $\{\frac{4^n x-1}{3}:~n \ge 0\}$
 if $x \equiv 1~(\bmod~3)$ and
$\{\frac{4^n (2x)-1}{3}: ~n \ge 0\}$
 if $x \equiv 2~(\bmod~3)$.
 They encode the trajectory of this function with a vector $(p_1, p_2, p_3, ...)$ which keeps
 track of the powers of $2$ divided out at each iteration.
 More generally they consider the speeded-up $(ax+d)$-function, with $a, d$ odd.
 For   $y_0$ an initial value (with $y_0 \ne -\frac{d}{a}$), 
 the iterates are $y_i= \frac{a y_{i-1} + d}{2^{p_{i+1}}}$.
They encode this  iteration for $n$ steps by an $n \times n$ matrix
 $$
\Theta:= \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc}
 2^{p_1} & 0 &0 & \cdots & 0 & -a\\
 -a & 2^{p_2} & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & -a & 2^{p_3} &     \cdots    &  0  & 0 \\
  & \cdots &&\cdots &&\\
  0&0&0& \cdots &-a& 2^{p_n} \\
 \end{array}
 \right],
$$ 
which acts by 
$$
\Theta \left[ \begin{array}{c} 
y_1\\ y_2 \\ y_3\\ \cdots\\ y_n\\ 
\end{array} \right] =
 \left[ \begin{array}{c} 
d - a(y_n-y_0) \\ d\\ d\\ \cdots \\d \\ 
\end{array} \right] .
$$
The authors observe that $\det(\Theta) = 2^{p_1+\cdots + p_n} - a^n.$
A  periodic orbit, one with $y_n=y_0$,
corresponds to a vector of iterates mapping to the vector with
constant entries $d$. They compute examples for  periodic orbits of $5x+1$ problem, and the $3x+1$ problem
on negative integers.
Finally they study orbits with $y_0$ a rational number with denominator
relatively prime to $a$, and give some examples of periodic orbits.

The author studies a $2$-adic interpolation of the speeded-up Collatz function $\phi(n)$
defined on odd integers $n$ by 
dividing out all powers of $2$, i.e. for an odd integer $n$, 
$\phi(n) = \frac{3n+1}{2^p(3n+1)}$,
where $p(m)= ord_2(m).$  Let $\ZZ_2^{\ast}=\{ x \in \ZZ_2: ~x \equiv 1 ~(\bmod~2)\}$ denote the
$2$-adic units. The author sets $OQ:= \QQ \cap \ZZ_2^{\ast}, $ and one has
$\ZZ_2^{\ast}$ is the closure $\overline{OQ}$ of $OQ \subset \ZZ_2$. 
The author shows that the map $\phi$ uniquely
extends to a continuous function
 $\phi: \ZZ_2^{\ast} \smallsetminus \{-\frac{1}{3} \}  \to \ZZ_2^{\ast}$.
 % Furthermore he extends it
%to a map $\phi: \ZZ_2 \backslash \{0, -\frac{1}{3} \} \to  \ZZ_2^{\ast}.$
He shows that if $f(x) = 2x+ \frac{1}{3}$ then $f(x)$ leaves $\phi$ invariant,
in the sense that $\phi(f(x))= \phi(x)$ for all $x \in \ZZ_2^{\ast}  \smallsetminus \{-\frac{1}{3} \} .$
It follows that $f(f(x))= 4x+1$ also leaves $\phi$ invariant.

To each $x \in \ZZ_2^{\ast}   \smallsetminus \{-\frac{1}{3} \} $ he associates
 the sequence of $2$-exponents  $(p_1, p_2, ...)$ produced by iterating $\phi$.
 He proves that
an element $x \in \ZZ_2^{\ast}   \smallsetminus \{\frac{-1}{3} \} $ uniquely determine $x$;
and  that every possible sequence corresponds to some value
$x \in \ZZ_2^{\ast}   \smallsetminus \{-\frac{1}{3} \} $ 
He shows that all periodic points of $\phi$ on $\ZZ_2^{\ast}$ are rational numbers
 $x=\frac{p}{q} \in OQ$,and that there
 is a unique such periodic point for any finite sequence $(p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_m)$
 of positive integers, representing $2$-exponents, having  period $m$.
 If $ C(p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m}) = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} 2^{p_1 + \cdots + p_j} 3^{m-1-j} $
 then this periodic pont is 
 $$
x= R(p_1, p_2..., p_m):= \frac{C(p_1, ..., p_m)}{2^{p_1 + \cdots + p_m} - 3^m}
$$
He shows that an orbit is periodic if and only if its sequence of $2$-exponents is
 periodic.

This paper studies iteration of maps $g  : \ZZ  \rightarrow  \ZZ$
of the form $g(m) =  \frac{1}{d} (a_r m  +  b_r )$ if
$m  \equiv  r~ (\bmod  ~d$) for $0 \leq r \leq  d  -  1$,
where $d  \geq  2$ is an
arbitrary integer, and 
all $a_r, ~b_r  \in  \ZZ$.
These maps generalize the $(3x  +  1)$-function, and include a
wider class of such functions than in Venturini\ (1989).
The author's methods, starting in section 3,  are similar in spirit to
the Markov chain methods  introduced by Leigh (1985), which in turn
were motivated by work of 
Matthews and Watts (1984, 1985).

The author is concerned with classifying $g$-ergodic sets $S$
of such $g$ which are finite unions of
congruence classes.
For example, the mapping $g(3m) =  2m$,
$g(3m  +  1) =  4m  +  3$ and
$g(3m  +  2) =  4m  +  1$ is a
permutation and has $S =  \{ m : m   \equiv  0$ or $5 (\bmod  ~10)\}$ as a
$g$-ergodic set.
He then associates a (generally finite) Markov chain to such a
$g$-ergodic set,
whose stationary distribution is used to derive a
conjecture for the distribution of iterates
$\{ g^{(k)} (n_0 : k  \geq  1 \}$ in these
residue classes for a randomly chosen initial value $n_0$ in $S$.
For the example above the stationary distribution is
$p_0 =  \frac{1}{3}$ and $p_5 =  \frac{2}{3}$.
One can obtain also conjectured growth rates $a( g |_S )$ for
iterates of a randomly chosen initial value in a
$g$-ergodic set $S$.
For the example above one obtains
$a(g| s) =  ( \frac{4}{3} )^{2/3} { 2 \choose 3} \cong 1.0583$.


The author classifies  maps $g$ into classes $G_v (d)$, for
$v =  0,1,2 , \ldots ,$ with an additional  class $G_\infty (d)$.
The parameter $v$ measures the extent to which the 
numerators $a_r$ of iterates of $g(v)$ have common factors with $d$.
The class $G_0(d)$  consists of those maps  $g$ having 
$gcd(a_0a_1 ...a_{d-1},d)=1$, which is exactly
the {\em relatively prime case}  treated in Matthews and Watts (1984)
and the class  $G_1(d)$  are exactly those
 maps having $gcd(a_r, d^2)= gcd(a_r, d)$ for all $r$, which were  the class
 of maps treated in
Matthews and Watts (1985).
His Theorem 7  shows that for each finite $v$ 
both of Leigh's Markov chains for auxilary modulus $m=d$ are finite for all maps in $G_v(d)$ 
(strengthening Leigh's Theorem 7).   The maps  in the exceptional class
$G_\infty(d)$  sometimes, but not always,  lead to infinite Markov chains.
The class $G_\infty (d)$ presumably contains functions 
constructed by J. H. Conway
[Proc. 1972 Number Theory Conf., U. of Colorado,
Boulder 1972, 39-42] which have all $b_r =  0$ and which can encode
computationally undecidable problems.

The proof of the author's Corollary to Theorem~6 is incomplete and the
result is not established:
It remains an open problem whether a $\ZZ$-permutation having an
ergodic set $S$ with $a(g |_S )  >  1$ contains any orbit that is infinite.
Sections~6 and 7 of the paper contain many interesting examples of
Markov chains associated to such functions $g$; these examples are worth
looking at for motivation before reading the rest of the paper.

This paper considers mappings $T(x) = \frac {t_r  x  -  u_r }{p}$
when $x  \equiv  r~ (\bmod  ~p$), having
$t_r  \in \ZZ^+ $, and $u_r   \equiv  rt_r~ (\bmod  ~p$).
It shows that if gcd $(t_0 t_1 \ldots t_{p-1} , p) =  1$ and
$t_0 t_1 \ldots  t_{p-1}  <  p^p$ then for any fixed
$\rho$ with $0  <  \rho  <  1$ almost all $m  \in  \ZZ$ have an

The paper also considers the question:
when are such mappings $T$ permutations of $\ZZ$?
It proves they are if and only if
$\sum_{r=0}^{p-1}\frac{1}{t_r} =  1$ and
$T(r)  \not\equiv  T(s)~ (\bmod  ~(t_r ,  t_s )$)

The geometric-harmonic mean inequality implies

This paper calls Collatz function iterates ``Wondrous Numbers'' and
attributes this name to D. Hofstadter,
{\em G\"odel, Escher, Bach.}
He proposes studying iterates of the class of ``MU'' functions
$$
F_D(x) =  \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\df{x}{D} & \mbox{if}~~x \equiv 0~ (\bmod  ~D) ~, \\
~~~ \\
(D+1)x-j & \mbox{if}~~x \equiv j ~ (\bmod  ~D) ,~~ 1 \leq j \leq D-2~, \\
~~~ \\
(D+1)x+1 & \mbox{if}~~x \equiv -1~ (\bmod  ~D) ~,
\end{array}
\right.
$$
$F_D $ is the Collatz function for $D =  2$.
Wiggin's analogue of the $3x  +  1$ conjecture for a given 
$D  \geq  2$ is that all iterates of $F_D(n)$
for $n  \geq  1$ reach some number
smaller than $D$.
Somewhat surprisingly, no $D$ is known for which this is false.
It could be shown false for a given $D$ by exhibiting a cycle with all
members $ > D$; no such cycles exist for $x < 3 \times 10^4$ for 
$2 \leq  D  \leq  12$.

The author constructs from the inverse iterates of the $3x+1$ function
(`backward Syracuse algorithm') a Markov chain defined on the state space
$[0,1] \times \ZZ_3^\times$,
in which $\ZZ_3^\times$ is the set of invertible 3-adic integers.
He lets $g_n (k,a)$ count the number of ``small sequence''
preimages of an element $a \in \ZZ_3^\times$
at depth $n+k$, which has $n$ odd iterates among its preimages, and
with symbol sequence 
$0^{\alpha_0} 1 0^{\alpha_1} \cdots 1 0^{\alpha_{n-1}} 1$,
with $\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i = k$ satisfying the ``small sequence'' condition
$0 \leq \alpha_j < 2 \cdot 3^{j-1}$ for $0 \leq j \leq n-1$.
These quantities satisfy a functional equation

$$

He obtains, in
a weak limiting sense, a Markov chain whose
probability density of being at $(x, a )$ is a limiting average of
$\hat{g}(x, a )$ in a neighborhood of $(x,a)$
as the neighborhood shrinks to $(x, \alpha )$.
One step of the backward Syracuse algorithm induces (in some limiting
average sense) a limiting Markovian transition measure,

density taking the form of a product measure

This paper studies the set $P(a)$ of inverse images of an integer $a$
under the $3x+1$ function.
Encode iterates $T^{(k)} (n) =  a$ by a set of
nonnegative integers $( \alpha_0 , \alpha_1, \ldots , \alpha_\mu )$
such that the 0-1 vector
$\bv$ encoding
$\{ T^{(j)} (n)~ (\bmod~2)$:
$0 \leq j \leq k -1 \}$
has $\bv = 0^{\alpha_0} 1~0^{\alpha_1} \cdots 1~0^{\alpha_\mu}$.
Wirsching studies iterates corresponding to ``small sequences,''
which are ones with $0 \leq \alpha_i < 2 \cdot 3^{i-1}$.
He lets $G_\mu (a)$ denote the set of ``small sequence'' 
preimages $n$ of $a$
having a fixed number $\mu$ of iterates
$T^{(j)} (n)  \equiv  1~~(\bmod~ 2)$, and shows that
$| G_\mu (a)| = 2^{\mu -1} 3^{1/2 ( \mu -1 \ldots \mu -2)}$.
He lets $g_a (k, \mu )$ denote the number of such sequences with
$k =  \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 +  \cdots  +  \alpha_\mu$, and introduces
related combinatorial quantities $\psi ( k, \mu )$ satisfying
$\sum_{0 \leq l \leq k} \psi ( l, \mu -1 )  \geq  g_a (k, \mu )$.
The quantities $\psi ( k, \mu )$ can be asymptotically estimated, and have a
(normalized) limiting distribution
$$
\psi (x)  =  \lim_{\mu  \rightarrow  \infty }
\frac{3^\mu - \mu}{2^\mu 3^{1/2\mu (\mu -1)}} 
\psi ([3^\mu - \mu ) x] , \mu ) .
$$
$\psi (x)$
is supported on $[0,1]$ and is a $C^\infty$-function.
He suggests a heuristic argument to estimate the number of ``small sequence''
preimages of $a$ smaller than $2^n a$, in terms of a double integral 
involving the
function $\psi (x)$.

This volume is a revised version of  the author's  Habilitationsscrift
(Katholische Universit\"at Eichst\"att 1996). 
It studies the problem of showing that
for each positive integer $a \not\equiv 0 ~ ( \bmod ~3)$ a
positive proportion of integers less than $x$ iterate to $a$, as 
$x \rightarrow \infty$.
It develops an interesting 3-adic approach to this problem.
\newline
\hspace*{.25in}Chapter~I contains a history of work
on the $3x+1$ problem,
and a summary of known results.
\newline
\hspace*{.25in}Chapter~II studies the graph of iterates of $T$ on the positive
integers, (``Collatz graph'')
and, in particular studies the graph $\Pi^a ( \Gamma_T )$ connecting
all the inverse iterates $P(a)$ of a given positive integer
$a$.
This graph is a tree for any noncyclic value $a$.
Wirsching uses a special encoding of the symbolic dynamics of
paths in such trees, which
enumerates symbol sequences by keeping track of the successive blocks of 0's.
He then characterizes which graphs $\Pi^a ( \Gamma_T )$
contain a given symbol sequence reaching the root node $a$.
He derives ``counting functions'' for such sequences, and uses them to
obtain a formula giving a lower bound for the function
$$
P_T^n (a) : = \{m : 2^n a \leq m < 2^{n+1} a ~~
\mbox{and~some~iterate ~ $T^{(j)} (m) = a \}$} ~,
$$
which states that
\beql{eq1}
|P_T^n (a) | : = \{ m : 2^n (a) : = \sum_{\ell = 0}^\infty e_\ell
(n + \lfloor \log_2 \left( \df{3}{2} \right) \ell \rfloor ~,  ~~ a)~,
\eeq
where $e_\ell (k,a)$ is a ``counting function.''
(Theorem~II.4.9).
The author's hope is to use (\ref{eq1}) to prove that
\beql{eq2}
|P_T^n (a) | > c(a)2^n ~,~~ n = 1,2 , \ldots ~.
\eeq
for some constant $c(a) > 0$.
\newline
\hspace*{.25in}Chapter~III studies the counting functions appearing in the
lower bound above, in the hope of proving (2).
Wirsching observes that the ``counting functions''
$e_\ell (k,a)$, which are ostensibly defined for positive integer variables
$k , \ell , a$,
actually are well-defined when the variable $a$ is a 3-adic integer.
He makes use of the fact that one can
define a `Collatz graph' $\Pi^a ( \Gamma_T )$ in which $a$ is a
3-adic integer, by taking a suitable limiting process.
Now the right side of (\ref{eq1}) makes sense for all 3-adic integers, and
he proves that actually $s_n (a) = + \infty$
on a dense set of 3-adic integers $a$.
(This is impossible for any integer $a$ because
$|P_T^n (a) | \leq 2^n a$.)
He then proves that $s_n (a)$ is a nonnegative integrable function 
of a 3-adic
variable, and he proves that its expected value $\bar{s}_n$ is explicitly
expressible using binomial coefficients.
Standard methods of asymptotic analysis are used to estimate $\bar{s}_n$,
and to show that
\beql{eq3}
\liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} \df{\bar{s}_n}{2^n} > 0 ~,
\eeq
which is Theorem~III.5.2.
In view of (\ref{eq1}), this says that (\ref{eq2}) ought to hold in some
``average'' sense.
He then proposes that (\ref{eq2}) holds due to the: \\

{\bf Heuristic Principle.}
{\em As $n \rightarrow \infty$, $s_n (a)$ becomes relatively close to
$\bar{s}_n$, in the weak sense that there is an absolute constant
$c_1 > 0$ such that}
\beql{eq4}
s_n (a) > c_1 \bar{s}_n ~~ for ~ all ~ n > n_0 (a) ~.
\eeq
One expects this to be true for all positive integers $a$.
A very interesting idea here is that it might conceivably be true 
for all 3-adic
integers $a$.
If so, there is some chance to rigorously prove it.
\newline
\hspace*{.25in}Chapter~IV studies this heuristic principle further 
by expressing
the counting function $e_\ell (k,a)$ in terms of simpler counting
functions $g_\ell (k,a )$ via a recursion
$$
e_\ell (k,a) = \sum_{j=0}^k p_\ell (k-j) g_\ell (j,a ) ~,
$$
in which $p_\ell (m)$ counts partitions of $m$ into parts of a 
special form.
Wirsching proves that properly scaled versions of the functions 
$g_\ell$ ``converge''
(in a rather weak sense) to a limit function which is independent of $a$,
namely
\beql{eq5}
g_\ell (k,a) \approx 2^{\ell-1} 3^{ \frac{1}{2} ( \ell^2 - 5 \ell +2)}
\psi \left( \df{k}{3^\ell} \right) ~,
\eeq
for ``most'' values of $k$ and $a$.
(The notion of convergence involves integration against test functions.)

(Katholische Universit\"at Eichst\"att 1996). It studies the problem of showing
that for each positive integer $a \not\equiv 0 ~ ( \bmod ~3)$ a positive
proportion of integers less than $x$ iterate to $a$, as $x \rightarrow \infty$.
It develops an interesting 3-adic approach to this problem. \newline
\hspace*{.25in}Chapter~I contains a history of work on the $3x+1$ problem, and a
summary of known results. \newline \hspace*{.25in}Chapter~II studies the graph
of iterates of $T$ on the positive integers, (``Collatz graph'') and, in
particular studies the graph $\Pi^a ( \Gamma_T )$ connecting all the inverse
iterates $P(a)$ of a given positive integer $a$. This graph is a tree for any
noncyclic value $a$. Wirsching uses a special encoding of the symbolic dynamics
of paths in such trees, which enumerates symbol sequences by keeping track of
the successive blocks of 0's. He then characterizes which graphs $\Pi^a (
\Gamma_T )$ contain a given symbol sequence reaching the root node $a$. He
derives ``counting functions'' for such sequences, and uses them to obtain a
formula giving a lower bound for the function $$ P_T^n (a) : = \{m : 2^n a \leq
m < 2^{n+1} a ~~ \mbox{and~some~iterate ~ $T^{(j)} (m) = a \}$} ~, $$ which
states that \beql{eq1} |P_T^n (a) | : = \{ m : 2^n (a) : = \sum_{\ell =
0}^\infty e_\ell (n + \lfloor \log_2 \left( \df{3}{2} \right) \ell \rfloor ~, ~~
a)~, \eeq where $e_\ell (k,a)$ is a ``counting function.'' (Theorem~II.4.9). The
author's hope is to use (\ref{eq1}) to prove that \beql{eq2} |P_T^n (a) | >
c(a)2^n ~,~~ n = 1,2 , \ldots ~. \eeq for some constant $c(a) > 0$. \newline
\hspace*{.25in}Chapter~III studies the counting functions appearing in the lower
bound above, in the hope of proving (2). Wirsching observes that the ``counting
functions'' $e_\ell (k,a)$, which are ostensibly defined for positive integer
variables $k , \ell , a$, actually are well-defined when the variable $a$ is a
3-adic integer. He makes use of the fact that one can define a `Collatz graph'
$\Pi^a ( \Gamma_T )$ in which $a$ is a 3-adic integer, by taking a suitable
limiting process. Now the right side of (\ref{eq1}) makes sense for all 3-adic
integers, and he proves that actually $s_n (a) = + \infty$ on a dense set of
3-adic integers $a$. (This is impossible for any integer $a$ because $|P_T^n (a)
| \leq 2^n a$.) He then proves that $s_n (a)$ is a nonnegative integrable
function of a 3-adic variable, and he proves that its expected value $\bar{s}_n$
is explicitly expressible using binomial coefficients. Standard methods of
asymptotic analysis are used to estimate $\bar{s}_n$, and to show that
\beql{eq3} \liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} \df{\bar{s}_n}{2^n} > 0 ~, \eeq which
is Theorem~III.5.2. In view of (\ref{eq1}), this says that (\ref{eq2}) ought to
hold in some ``average'' sense. He then proposes that (\ref{eq2}) holds due to
the: \\ {\bf Heuristic Principle.} {\em As $n \rightarrow \infty$, $s_n (a)$
becomes relatively close to $\bar{s}_n$, in the weak sense that there is an
absolute constant $c_1 > 0$ such that} \beql{eq4} s_n (a) > c_1 \bar{s}_n ~~ for
~ all ~ n > n_0 (a) ~. \eeq One expects this to be true for all positive
integers $a$. A very interesting idea here is that it might conceivably be true
for all 3-adic integers $a$. If so, there is some chance to rigorously prove it.
\newline \hspace*{.25in}Chapter~IV studies this heuristic principle further by
expressing the counting function $e_\ell (k,a)$ in terms of simpler counting
functions $g_\ell (k,a )$ via a recursion $$ e_\ell (k,a) = \sum_{j=0}^k p_\ell
(k-j) g_\ell (j,a ) ~, $$ in which $p_\ell (m)$ counts partitions of $m$ into
parts of a special form. Wirsching proves that properly scaled versions of the
functions $g_\ell$ ``converge'' (in a rather weak sense) to a limit function
which is independent of $a$, namely \beql{eq5} g_\ell (k,a) \approx 2^{\ell-1}
3^{ \frac{1}{2} ( \ell^2 - 5 \ell +2)} \psi \left( \df{k}{3^\ell} \right) ~,
\eeq for ``most'' values of $k$ and $a$. (The notion of convergence involves
integration against test functions.) The limit function $\psi : [0,1]
\rightarrow \RR$ satisfies the functional-differential equation \beql{eq6}
\psi'(t) = \df{9}{2} ( \psi (3t) - \psi (3t -2 )) ~. \eeq He observes that
$\psi$ has the property of being $C^\infty$ and yet is piecewise polynomial,
with infinitely many pieces, off a set of measure zero. There is a fairly well
developed theory for related functional-differential equations, cf. V. A.

This paper considers the Collatz function (denoted $J(n)$)  viewing iteration of the
function as a directed graph, with edges from $n \to J(n)$. The set $N_J$ of Kakutani
numbers is the set of all numbers that iterate to $1$; these form a connected graph.  
It phrases the $3x+1$ conjecture
as asserting that all  positive integers are ``Kakutani numbers." 

 It also discusses the ``black hole" problem, which concerns iteration on  $n$-digit 
 integers (in base $10$), taking $K(n) = n^{+} - n^{-}$ where $n^{+}$ is the $n$-digit
 integer obtained from $n$, arranging digits in decreasing order,
 and $n^{-}$ arranging digits in increasing order. This iteration can
 be arranged in a  directed graph with edges from $n$ to $T(n)$. It
 is known that  for $3$-digit numbers, $T(\cdot)$ iterates to the fixed point $n=495$,
 and for $4$-digit numbers it iterates to the fixed point $n=6174$
 (the "Kaprekar constant").  For
 more than $4$-digits, iterations may enter cycles of period exceeding
 one, called  here ``black holes".
 For $n=6$ there is a cycle of length $7$ with
 $n=840852$, and for $n=9$ there is a cycle of length $14$ starting with $n=864197532$. 
The paper is descriptive, with examples but no proofs.

{\em Note.} The ``black hole" problem has
a long history. The starting point was: D. R. Kaprekar, {\em An interesting property of the
number 6174}, Scripa Math. {\bf 21} (1955) 244-245.

This function for  $(d,k)=(1,0)$ is the Collatz  function.  
The author actually does not give a tie-breaking rule for defining the
function when several $p_j$ divide $x$. However, this is not
important in studying  the conjecture below. 

The author formulates the {\em Kakutani $(d, k)$-Conjecture}, which states that the
function $T_{d,k}(x)$ iterated on the positive integers always reaches the
integer $(p_{d+1})^k$. Note  that $(p_{d+1})^k$ always belongs to 
a cycle of the function $T_{d,k}(x)$.
This conjecture for $(1,k)$ was presented
earlier by the author,
%in ZHANG, Cheng Yu (1987), 
where it was shown equivalent to the $3x+1$ Conjecture. 

The author shows this conjecture is false for $d=4,5, 6, 8$ because
there is a nontrivial cycle. The cycles he finds, for given $p_{d+1}$ and  starting
value $n$ are:  $p_5=11 ~(n=17), ~p_6=13 ~(n=19),~ p_7=17~ (n=243),
~p_9=29 ~(n=179).$

The author then modifies the Kakutani $(d,k)$-Conjecture in these cases to say that every
orbit on the positive integers enters one of the known cycles. 
For example he modifies Conjecture $(4,k)$ to say that all orbits
reach the value $(11)^k$ or else enter the cycle containing $ 17 \cdot (11)^k$. 
He proves that the  Conjecture $(d, k)$ is equivalent to the
modified Conjecture $(d, 0)$ for $d=1, 2, 3, 4.$

$n \equiv 7, 15, 27, 31, 39, 63, 79$ or $91~(\bmod ~96).$ It also proves
that if $2^{2m+1} - 1 \in H$ then $2^{2m+2} - 1 \in H.$ Finally the paper observes 
 that the numerical computation of $C(n)$ could be simplified
if it were performed in base $3$.
